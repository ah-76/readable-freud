Recommendations for Practicing Psychoanalysis (1912)
Freud explains his technique of listening to patients’ free associations with evenly suspended attention. He emphasizes the importance of neutrality, avoiding preconceived notions or selective focus, and relying on the analyst’s unconscious memory to uncover the hidden patterns and meanings in the patient’s associations.

The technical rules I propose here have emerged from my own extensive experience after learning from my own mistakes and abandoning other methods. You'll quickly notice that many of these rules can be condensed into a single guideline. I hope that considering them will save analysts a lot of unnecessary effort and help them avoid many oversights. However, I must explicitly state that this technique has proven to be the only practical one for my personality. I do not dare deny that a therapist with a completely different constitution might be inclined to prefer a different approach to patients and the tasks at hand.

<strong>SECTION A</strong>

The next challenge facing the analyst, who treats more than one patient daily, will also appear to be the most difficult. It consists of remembering all the countless names, dates, memories, ideas, and symptoms that a patient presents over the months and years of treatment, without confusing them with similar material from other patients analyzed concurrently or in the past. If one is required to analyze six, eight, or even more patients daily, such a feat of memory will evoke disbelief, admiration, or even pity from outsiders. In any case, people will be curious about the technique that allows one to handle such a workload, and will expect it to involve some special aids.

This technique is quite simple. It rejects all aids, as we'll see, even writing things down. It simply involves not trying to remember anything specific and bringing the same evenly suspended attention, as I once called it, to everything you hear. By doing this, you avoid straining your attention, which you couldn't maintain for many hours daily, and you also avoid a danger inherent in intentional concentration. As soon as you intentionally focus your attention to a certain degree, you start picking and choosing among the material presented to you. You fixate sharply on one piece, discard another, and make these selections based on your expectations or preferences. But you shouldn't do that. If you select based on expectations, you'll risk finding nothing new but what you already know. If you follow your preferences, you'll likely distort your perception. You must remember that most of what you'll hear will only reveal its significance later on.

The rule of maintaining an even attention to everything is the necessary counterpart to the instruction given to the patient to share everything that comes to mind without criticism or selection. If the analyst behaves differently, they largely undermine the benefit that comes from the patient's adherence to the fundamental rule of psychoanalysis. The rule for the analyst can be expressed like this: Keep all conscious influences away from your memory and fully trust your unconscious memory, or, put simply: <strong>Listen and don't worry about remembering anything</strong>.

What you achieve in yourself this way is sufficient for all requirements during treatment. The parts of the material that already form a coherent pattern will be consciously available to the analyst. The other, still disorganized and chaotic parts might initially seem forgotten but will resurface in memory as soon as the patient mentions something new that connects with them and extends their meaning. You then smile at the undeserved compliment from the patient about your "exceptionally good memory" when you recall a detail after a year or so that would probably have escaped your conscious intention to remember it.

Mistakes in this recollection occur only occasionally and in areas where one's personal involvement interferes (see below), thus falling far short of the ideal of the analyst. Confusions with material from other patients are quite rare. In disputes with the patient about whether and how they said something specific, the analyst is usually in the right.

<strong>SECTION B</strong>

I cannot recommend taking extensive notes, keeping records, or the like during sessions with the patient. Aside from the negative impression this might leave on some patients, the same considerations apply here as with memory retention. You inevitably make a harmful selection from the material while writing or taking shorthand notes, and you tie up part of your own mental activity that would be better used in interpreting what you've heard. 

Exceptions to this rule can be made without criticism for dates, dream texts, or notable individual results that can easily be separated from their context and used independently as examples. However, I generally avoid even this. In the evening after finishing my work, I write down examples from memory, and I ask patients to record the dream texts that matter to me after recounting their dreams.

<hr>

<strong>SECTION C</strong>

Taking notes during the session with the patient might be justified by the intention to make the case the subject of a scientific publication. This can hardly be denied in principle. However, it must be remembered that detailed protocols in a psychoanalytic case history deliver less than one might expect. Strictly speaking, they belong to that pseudo-precision for which "modern" psychiatry provides us with some striking examples. They are usually exhausting for the reader and cannot replace being present at the analysis.

We have generally found that if the reader wants to believe the analyst, they will also give them credit for the bit of editing they've done to the material. But if they don't take the analysis or the analyst seriously, they will dismiss even accurate treatment protocols. This does not seem to be the way to remedy the lack of evidence found in psychoanalytic presentations.

<strong>SECTION D</strong>

Although one of the distinctions of psychoanalytic work is that research and treatment coincide, the technique that serves one purpose inevitably opposes the other beyond a certain point. It's not advisable to work on a case scientifically while its treatment is still ongoing, to try to piece together its structure, predict its progress, or periodically take snapshots of its current status, as scientific interest would require.

Success suffers in cases that are designated for scientific utilization from the outset and treated according to its needs. On the other hand, those cases in which one proceeds as if aimlessly, allowing oneself to be surprised by every twist and approaching them with an open and unbiased attitude, are the ones that succeed best. The right approach for the analyst is to switch between the two mental attitudes as needed, to avoid speculation and rumination while analyzing, and only subject the material to synthetic thinking after the analysis is complete.

This distinction between the two attitudes would be meaningless if we already possessed all or at least the essential insights into the psychology of the unconscious and the structure of neuroses that we can gain from psychoanalytic work. At present, we are far from this goal and must not close off the avenues for verifying what we've already learned and discovering new things.

<strong>SECTION E</strong>

I cannot recommend strongly enough that my colleagues take the surgeon as their model during psychoanalytic treatment. The surgeon puts aside all his emotions and even his human compassion, focusing his mental energies solely on performing the operation as skillfully as possible. For the psychoanalyst, under current circumstances, the most dangerous emotional drive is therapeutic ambition—the desire to achieve something convincing with his new and much-contested method. 

This ambition not only puts the analyst in a state unfavorable to his work, but also leaves him defenseless against certain resistances of the patient, on whose dynamics recovery primarily depends. The justification for this emotional detachment, which should be expected of the analyst, is that it creates the most favorable conditions for both parties: for the analyst, it ensures the desirable protection of his own emotional life, and for the patient, it provides the greatest level of assistance currently possible.

An old surgeon had as his motto: 'Je le pansai, Dieu le guérit' - I dressed his wounds, and God healed him. The analyst should be content with something similar.

<strong>SECTION F</strong>

It's easy to guess the goal at which these individual rules converge. They all aim to establish in the analyst the counterpart to the 'fundamental rule' of psychoanalysis set for the patient. Just as the patient shares everything they observe within themselves - setting aside any logical or emotional objections that might lead them to hold back - the analyst must be able to use everything communicated to them. This allows the analyst to interpret and uncover the hidden unconscious without replacing the patient's abandoned selection with their own censorship.

As a formula: the analyst turns their own unconscious as a receptive entity toward the giving unconscious of the patient. They align themselves with the patient like a phone's microphone picks up and converts spoken words into sound. Just as the microphone converts sound waves into electronic signals, the unconscious of the analyst is able to reconstruct the unconscious of the patient. They use the derivatives of the unconscious communicated to them, which first determined the patient's associations.

If the analyst is to use their unconscious as an instrument in analysis, they must fulfill a psychological requirement to a great extent. They must not tolerate any resistances within themselves that would prevent what is recognized by their unconscious from reaching their consciousness. Otherwise, they would introduce a new form of selection and distortion into the analysis, which would be far more damaging than that caused by the strain of their conscious attention.

It's not enough for the analyst to be a relatively normal person. Instead, they should have undergone a psychoanalytic 'purification', and gained awareness of their personal complexes that could interfere with understanding what the patient presents. The disqualifying effect of such personal shortcomings can hardly be doubted. As Wilhelm Stekel aptly put it, every unresolved repression in the analyst corresponds to a <strong>blind spot</strong> in their analytical perception.

Years ago, when asked how one could become an analyst, I replied: <em>by analyzing one's own dreams</em>. This preparation is certainly sufficient for many people, but not for everyone who wishes to learn analysis. Not everyone succeeds in interpreting their own dreams without outside help. One of the many merits of the Zurich school of analysis is that they tightened this requirement and formalized the rule that anyone who wishes to conduct analyses on others should first undergo an analysis with a qualified professional.

Anyone serious about the task should choose this path, which promises more than one advantage. The sacrifice of revealing oneself to another person without the compulsion of illness is richly rewarded. They will not only realize their intention of uncovering the hidden aspects of their own personality in far less time, and with less emotional effort. They will also gain insights and convictions firsthand that are sought in vain through studying books and listening to lectures. Finally, the lasting psychological relationship that usually develops between the analyzed and their introducer should not be underestimated.

Such an analysis of a practically healthy person will understandably remain unfinished. Those who appreciate the high value of the self-knowledge and increased self-control gained through this process will continue their analytical exploration as self-analysis and will be content with the fact that they can always expect to find something new within themselves and in the world around them. 

However, an analyst who neglects the precaution of self-analysis will not only be punished by the inability to learn more from their patients beyond a certain limit. They will also face a more serious danger that can become a threat to others. They will be easily tempted to project what they recognize about their own personality in vague self-perception as a universally valid theory onto the field of science. They will discredit the psychoanalytic method and mislead the inexperienced.

<strong>SECTION G</strong>

Here are a few more rules, marking the transition from the analyst's attitude to the treatment of the patient.

It's certainly tempting for the young and eager psychoanalyst to invest much of their own individuality in order to sweep the patient along with them and elevate them beyond the limits of their narrow personality. One might think it entirely permissible and even advantageous in overcoming the patient's resistances for the analyst to allow the patient insight into their own psychological defects and conflicts, and to enable equality through personal disclosures from their life. Trust deserves trust, and anyone who demands intimacy from another must also show it themselves.

However, in psychoanalytic practice, many things proceed differently than we might expect based on the assumptions of 'consciousness psychology'. Experience doesn't support the superiority of such an emotional technique. It's also not hard to see that it strays from the psychoanalytic foundation and approaches suggestion-based treatments. This technique might make it easier for the patient to share what they already know and what they would otherwise hold back due to conventional resistance. But it does nothing to uncover the patient's unconscious, making them even less capable of overcoming deeper resistances.

In more severe cases, it regularly fails due to the patient's awakened insatiability, who would then prefer to reverse roles and find analyzing the analyst more interesting than analyzing themselves. Furthermore, resolving the transference, one of the main tasks of treatment, is made more difficult by the analyst's intimate approach, so any initial gains are ultimately more than offset. I have no hesitation in dismissing this type of technique as flawed.

The analyst should be opaque to the patient and, like a mirror, show nothing except what is shown to them. It's certainly practical for a psychotherapist to mix a bit of analysis with a portion of suggestive influence to achieve visible results in a shorter time, as is necessary in institutions. But it should be expected that they are not confused about what they're doing, and that they know their method is not that of proper psychoanalysis.

<strong>SECTION H</strong>

Another temptation arises from the educational role that naturally falls to the analyst during psychoanalytic treatment. When overcoming developmental inhibitions, the analyst often finds themselves guiding the newly freed impulses toward new goals. It's only natural for them to be ambitious and strive to shape the person they have worked so hard to free from neurosis into something truly exceptional, prescribing high aspirations for their desires. However, the analyst should maintain control and use the patient's aptitude as a guide rather than their own wishes.

Not all neurotics possess significant talent for sublimation, and it's safe to assume that many wouldn't have fallen ill at all if they had mastered the art of sublimating their drives. If they're pushed too hard toward sublimation and deprived of their nearest and most convenient forms of gratification, life often becomes even more difficult for them than they already perceive it to be.

As a analyst, one must be tolerant of the patient's weaknesses and be content with having helped even someone less capable regain a degree of productivity and enjoyment. Educational ambition is no more appropriate than therapeutic ambition. 

Moreover, many people have fallen ill precisely by trying to sublimate their drives beyond what their constitution allows. For those capable of sublimation, this process often happens naturally once their inhibitions are overcome through analysis.

So, I believe that while it's always commendable to regularly use psychoanalytic treatment for drive sublimation, it's certainly not advisable in every case.

<strong>SECTION I</strong>

To what extent should the intellectual cooperation of the patient be sought during treatment? It's difficult to say anything universally applicable here. The patient's personality is the primary deciding factor. However, caution and restraint should always be exercised.

It's incorrect to set tasks for the patient, like gathering their memories or thinking about a specific period in their life. Instead, they must learn—something no one easily accepts—that mental effort such as thinking, willing, or focusing will not solve any of the mysteries of their neurosis. Only through the patient adherence to the psychoanalytic rule, which requires setting aside criticism against the unconscious and its derivatives, will progress be made.

This rule should be strictly enforced, especially with patients who tend to intellectualize during treatment, reflecting on their condition wisely and often, but avoiding actually doing something about it. Therefore, I don't like my patients to use the reading of analytic texts as a tool; I want them to learn from their own experience and assure them that they'll gain more and learn more valuable things this way than the entire psychoanalytic literature could tell them. 

However, I recognize that under the conditions of institutional care, it can be highly advantageous to use literature to prepare patients and create an atmosphere of influence.

I must urgently warn against seeking the approval and support of parents or relatives by giving them an introductory or in-depth work from our literature to read. This well-intentioned step often suffices to prematurely unleash the natural and inevitably forthcoming opposition of the relatives to the psychoanalytic treatment of their loved ones, preventing the treatment from even beginning.

I hope that as psychoanalysts gain more experience, we will soon reach an agreement on the best techniques for treating neurotics. However, regarding the treatment of 'relatives', I must confess my complete bewilderment and have little faith in treating them individually.
