### Chapter III: Moses, His People, and Monotheistic Religion

#### Part One

##### Prefatory Note I

*(Before March 1938)*

With the boldness of someone who has little or nothing to lose, I am breaking a well-founded resolution for the second time. I am adding the withheld conclusion to the two essays on Moses published in *Imago* (Volume XXIII, Issues 1 and 3). I concluded with the assertion that I knew my abilities would not be enough for this task, referring, of course, to the decline in creative faculties that comes with old age. I do not share the view of my contemporary, Bernard Shaw, who believed humans would only achieve something truly significant if they could live to be 300 years old. Extending life spans would achieve nothing unless many other fundamental aspects of living conditions were also changed. But I was also thinking of another obstacle.

We live in particularly peculiar times. We are astonished to find that progress has allied itself with barbarism. In Soviet Russia, there has been an attempt to elevate around 100 million oppressed people to better living conditions. They were bold enough to withdraw the "narcotic" of religion from them and wise enough to grant them a reasonable measure of sexual freedom. However, they subjected them to the most brutal compulsion and deprived them of any possibility of freedom of thought. With similar violence, the Italian people are being taught order and a sense of duty. It is somewhat of a relief from a pressing concern to see that in the case of the German people, the regression to almost prehistoric barbarism can occur without any affiliation to any progressive idea. Nonetheless, it has come to pass that today the conservative democracies have become the guardians of cultural progress, and it is especially peculiar that the institution of the Catholic Church is now vigorously opposing the spread of that cultural threat. This, despite having been the relentless enemy of freedom of thought and progress towards the knowledge of truth!
We live here in a Catholic country under the protection of the Church, uncertain about how long this protection will last. For as long as it does, we naturally hesitate to do anything that might provoke the Church’s hostility. This is not out of cowardice, but caution; the new enemy we are wary of serving is more dangerous than the old one we have already learned to deal with. The psychoanalytic research we conduct is already viewed with suspicious attention by Catholicism. We won't claim it's entirely unjustified. If our work leads us to a conclusion that reduces religion to a human neurosis and explains its immense power in the same way we explain neurotic compulsion in our patients, we are sure to attract the strongest resentment from the ruling authorities here. It’s not that we have anything new to say; what we are saying now is something we clearly stated over twenty-five years ago. But this has since been forgotten, and it will certainly have an impact if we repeat it today and illustrate it with a decisive example for all religious foundations. This would likely result in a ban on practicing psychoanalysis. Such violent methods of suppression are not unfamiliar to the Church; it perceives it as an intrusion into its privileges when others use them. However, psychoanalysis, which has spread everywhere during my long life, still has no home more valuable to it than the city where it was born and grew up.

I believe it, and I know it: I will be deterred by this other obstacle, this external danger, from publishing the last part of my study on Moses. I have made another attempt to clear the difficulty by telling myself that my fear is based on an overestimation of my personal importance. It is likely that the authorities will be indifferent to what I write about Moses and the origin of monotheistic religions. But I am not confident in this judgment. It seems more likely that malice and a thirst for sensation will compensate for what I lack in the estimation of my contemporaries. Therefore, I will not make this work public, but this does not need to stop me from writing it. Especially since I already wrote it two years ago, so I just need to revise it and append it to the previous two essays. It can then be kept hidden until a time comes when it can safely see the light of day, or until someone who shares these conclusions and opinions can be told that there was once someone in darker times who thought the same as you do.

<strong>PRELIMINARY NOTE II</strong>

(June 1938)
The unique difficulties I faced while writing this study on the figure of Moses—internal doubts and external obstacles—have resulted in this third and final essay being introduced by two different prefaces that contradict and even negate each other. During the brief period between writing them, my external circumstances changed drastically. At the time, I was under the protection of the Catholic Church and feared that publishing my work might jeopardize this protection and lead to a ban on psychoanalytic work for my followers and students in Austria. Then, the German invasion happened; Catholicism, to use a biblical phrase, proved to be a "shaky reed." Faced with the certainty of being persecuted not only for my ideas but also because of my "race," I left the city that had been my home for 78 years since childhood, along with many friends.

I found the warmest welcome in beautiful, free-spirited, and generous England. Here, I live as a well-received guest, relieved that the pressure has been lifted and that I can once again speak and write—almost, I might say, think—as I wish or need. I dare to bring this final piece of my work to the public.

There are no longer any external obstacles, or at least none that I need to fear. In the few weeks I've been here, I've received countless greetings from friends glad of my presence, from strangers, and even from those uninvolved who simply wanted to express their satisfaction that I have found freedom and safety here. Moreover, I was surprised by the frequency of letters from others concerned about my spiritual well-being, eager to guide me to Christ and enlighten me about the future of Israel.

These well-meaning individuals clearly did not know much about me. However, I expect that when this work on Moses is translated and becomes known among my new compatriots, I will lose some of the sympathies they currently extend to me.
**Internal Difficulties and Historical Context**

Political upheavals and changes in my place of residence have not altered my internal difficulties. I still feel uncertain about my own work and miss the sense of unity and connection that should exist between an author and their work. It's not that I lack conviction in the correctness of my conclusions. I gained that certainty a quarter of a century ago when I wrote "Totem and Taboo" in 1912, and it has only grown stronger since. I have never doubted that religious phenomena can only be understood through the lens of the familiar neurotic symptoms of individuals, as reenactments of long-forgotten, significant events in the ancient history of the human family. These phenomena owe their compulsive nature to this origin and, therefore, impact people due to their content of historical truth.

My uncertainty begins when I ask myself whether I have successfully demonstrated these principles in the specific case of Jewish monotheism. My critical perspective sees this work stemming from Moses as precariously balanced, like a dancer on the tip of her toe. If I couldn't rely on the analytical interpretation of the myth of Moses' abandonment and extend from there to Sellin's hypothesis about Moses' fate, the entire work would have remained unwritten. Nevertheless, I dare to proceed now.

I will start by summarizing the results of my second, purely historical study on Moses. These findings will not be subjected to further critique here, as they form the foundation of the psychological discussions that will stem from them and repeatedly refer back to them.

**A - The Historical Background**

The historical backdrop of the events that have captured our interest is as follows: Through the conquests of the 18th Dynasty, Egypt became a world empire. This new imperialism is reflected in the development of religious ideas, if not of the entire population, then certainly of the ruling and intellectually active upper class. Under the influence of the priests of the Sun God at On (Heliopolis), possibly bolstered by inspirations from Asia, the idea of a universal God, Aton, emerged—one that was not confined to a single country or people.

With the young Amenhotep IV ascending to power, a Pharaoh came to the throne who had no higher interest than the development of this divine concept. He elevated the Aton religion to the state religion, making the universal God the only God. Everything said about other gods was false and deceptive. With remarkable steadfastness, he resisted all temptations of magical thinking and rejected the illusion, particularly dear to Egyptians, of an afterlife. In a stunning anticipation of later scientific insights, he recognized the energy of solar radiation as the source of all life on Earth and revered it as the symbol of his God's power. He took pride in his joy of creation and his life in Maat (truth and justice).
This is the first and perhaps purest case of a monotheistic religion in human history. A deeper understanding of the historical and psychological conditions of its origin would be invaluable. However, efforts were made to ensure that not too much information about the Aton religion would reach us. Under the weak successors of Akhenaten, everything he had created collapsed. The revenge of the priesthoods he had suppressed raged against his memory. The Aton religion was abolished, and the residence of the branded heretic Pharaoh was destroyed and plundered. Around 1350 BCE, the 18th Dynasty came to an end. After a period of anarchy, General Horemheb, who ruled until 1315 BCE, restored order. Akhenaten's reform seemed to be an episode destined to be forgotten.

This is what has been historically established, and now our hypothetical continuation begins. Among those close to Akhenaten was a man who may have been named Thutmose, like many others at the time (the sculptor whose workshop was found in Tell-el-Amarna also bore this name). The name itself is not important, but the second part must have been -mose. He held a high position, was a fervent supporter of the Aton religion, and unlike the contemplative king, he was energetic and passionate. For this man, the downfall of Akhenaten and the abolition of his religion meant the end of all his hopes. He could only remain in Egypt as an outlaw or a renegade. Possibly, as the governor of a border province, he had come into contact with a Semitic tribe that had settled there a few generations earlier. In his despair and isolation, he turned to these foreigners, seeking compensation for his losses among them. He chose them as his people, attempting to realize his ideals with them. After leaving Egypt with his followers, he sanctified them through the rite of circumcision, gave them laws, and introduced them to the teachings of the Aton religion, which the Egyptians had just abandoned. Perhaps the rules Moses gave to his people were even stricter than those of his master and teacher Akhenaten. He might have also abandoned the association with the sun god of On, which Akhenaten had still maintained.
To date the Exodus from Egypt, we must place it around the interregnum period after 1350 BCE. The subsequent periods leading up to the conquest of Canaan are particularly obscure. From the darkness created or left by the biblical account, historical research today has managed to extract two key facts. The first, uncovered by E. Sellin, is that the Jews, who according to the Bible were stubborn and rebellious against their lawgiver and leader, eventually revolted against him, killed him, and discarded the imposed religion of Aton, much like the Egyptians had earlier. The second fact, proven by Ed. Meyer, is that these Jews who returned from Egypt later united with other closely related tribes in the area between Palestine, the Sinai Peninsula, and Arabia. In a water-rich place called Qadesh, under the influence of the Arabic Midianites, they adopted a new religion, the worship of the volcano god Yahweh. Soon after, they were ready to invade Canaan as conquerors.

The chronological relationship between these two events and the Exodus from Egypt is very uncertain. The next historical reference point is a stele of Pharaoh Merneptah (up to 1215 BCE), which mentions "Israel" among the defeated in his campaign report on Syria and Palestine. If we take the date of this stele as a terminus ad quem, then the entire sequence from the Exodus to this point spans about a century (from around 1350 BCE to before 1215 BCE). However, it is possible that the name "Israel" does not yet refer to the tribes whose fates we are tracing, and that we are actually dealing with a longer time frame. The settlement of the later Jewish people in Canaan was certainly not a swift conquest but a process that occurred in waves and extended over longer periods. 

If we free ourselves from the constraint imposed by the Merneptah stele, we can more easily consider a generation (30 years) as the time of Moses. This would correspond to the 40 years of wandering in the desert mentioned in the biblical text. Then, at least two generations, probably more, would pass until the union at Qadesh. The interval between Qadesh and the departure for Canaan need only be short. As shown in the previous discussion, Jewish tradition had good reasons to shorten the interval between the Exodus and the establishment of religion at Qadesh. The opposite is in the interest of our presentation.
But all of this is still history, an attempt to fill the gaps in our knowledge, partly a repetition from the second essay in *Imago*. Our interest follows the fates of Moses and his teachings, which the rebellion of the Jews only seemingly ended. From the account of the Yahwist, written around the year 1000 BCE but certainly based on earlier traditions, we have understood that the union and the establishment of religion in Qadesh involved a compromise. Both components of this compromise are still distinguishable. One side aimed only to deny the novelty and foreignness of the god Yahweh and to enhance his claim to the people's devotion. The other side did not want to forfeit cherished memories of the liberation from Egypt and the grand figure of Moses. They managed to incorporate both the fact and the man into the new narrative of prehistory, at least preserving the outward symbol of the religion of Moses, circumcision, and perhaps imposing certain restrictions on the use of the new god's name. We have stated that the representatives of these claims were the descendants of Moses' followers, the Levites, only a few generations removed from Moses' contemporaries and still bound by a living memory of his legacy. The elaborately embellished accounts attributed to the Yahwist and his later competitor, the Elohist, were like tombs under which the true knowledge of those early events, the nature of the Mosaic religion, and the violent removal of the great man was hidden from the knowledge of later generations, intended to find their eternal rest.

If our interpretation is correct, there is nothing mysterious about this process; however, it might very well have marked the definitive end of the Moses episode in the history of the Jewish people.

The remarkable thing, however, is that this is not the case. The strongest effects of that experience on the people only emerged later, gradually forcing their way into reality over the course of many centuries. It is unlikely that Yahweh differed much in character from the gods of the surrounding peoples and tribes; he struggled with them just as the peoples themselves fought with each other. But it is reasonable to assume that a follower of Yahweh at that time would not have thought to deny the existence of the gods of Canaan, Moab, Amalek, and so on, any more than the existence of the peoples who believed in them.
The monotheistic idea that briefly emerged with Ikhnaton was once again obscured and would remain in the dark for a long time. Discoveries on the island of Elephantine, just before the first cataract of the Nile, revealed the surprising news that there had been a Jewish military colony established there for centuries. In their temple, alongside the main god Jahu, two female deities were worshipped, one named Anat-Jahu. These Jews were cut off from their homeland and had not experienced the religious developments there. The Persian Empire's government (5th century) communicated the new religious regulations from Jerusalem to them. Going back to earlier times, we can say that the god Yahweh certainly bore no resemblance to the Mosaic god. Aton was a pacifist like his earthly representative, or rather his model, Pharaoh Ikhnaton, who passively watched as the world empire won by his ancestors disintegrated. For a people preparing to violently seize new territories, Yahweh was certainly more suitable. And everything venerable about the Mosaic god was entirely beyond the understanding of the primitive masses.

I have already mentioned—and have gladly referred to the agreement with others—that the central fact of Jewish religious development was that over time, the god Yahweh lost his original characteristics and increasingly resembled the old god of Moses, Aton. Although differences remained that one might initially consider significant, they are easily explained. Aton began to reign in Egypt during a fortunate time of secure possession, and even as the empire began to falter, his worshippers could turn away from the disturbances and continue to praise and enjoy his creations.

The Jewish people, however, faced a series of severe trials and painful experiences, and their god became harsh and stern, almost darkened. He retained the character of a universal god who presides over all lands and peoples, but the fact that his worship shifted from the Egyptians to the Jews was reflected in the belief that the Jews were his chosen people, whose special obligations would eventually bring special rewards. It might not have been easy for the people to reconcile their belief in their almighty god's favoritism with the sorrowful experiences of their unfortunate fates. But they did not waver; they intensified their own sense of guilt to suppress their doubts about God, and perhaps they ultimately pointed to "God's inscrutable counsel," as the devout still do today. If one wondered why God allowed new oppressors like the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians to arise and subjugate and mistreat them, they saw his power in that these evil enemies were themselves eventually defeated, and their empires disappeared.
In three key aspects, the later Jewish God finally became equivalent to the old Mosaic God. The first and most crucial point is that He was genuinely recognized as the one and only God, with no other being conceivable beside Him. The monotheism of Akhenaten was taken seriously by an entire people. In fact, this people clung so tightly to this idea that it became the main content of their spiritual life, leaving no room for other interests. The people and the ruling priesthood were united on this point. However, while the priests focused their efforts on expanding the ceremonial worship of this God, they found themselves at odds with strong movements within the populace that sought to revive two other teachings of Moses about God. The voices of the prophets tirelessly proclaimed that God despised ceremonial worship and sacrifices, demanding instead that people believe in Him and lead lives of truth and justice. When they praised the simplicity and sanctity of desert life, they were undoubtedly influenced by Mosaic ideals.

It's time to raise the question of whether it is even necessary to invoke Moses' influence on the final form of the Jewish concept of God, or if the idea of a spontaneous development towards higher spirituality over centuries of cultural life is sufficient. Regarding this possibility, which would end all our speculations, two points must be made. First, it explains nothing. The same conditions did not lead the highly gifted Greek people to monotheism but rather to the dissolution of polytheistic religion and the beginning of philosophical thought. In Egypt, monotheism, as far as we understand, emerged as a byproduct of imperialism, with God reflecting the absolute power of a Pharaoh ruling over a vast empire. Among the Jews, political conditions were highly unfavorable for the development from the idea of an exclusive national God to that of a universal ruler. Where did this tiny and powerless nation get the audacity to present itself as the favored child of the great Lord? The question of the origin of monotheism among the Jews would remain unanswered, or one would settle for the common answer that it was simply the expression of the unique religious genius of this people. Genius is known to be incomprehensible and unaccountable, and therefore it should not be invoked as an explanation until every other solution has failed. The same consideration applies to the remarkable case of William Shakespeare from Stratford.
Furthermore, we encounter the fact that Jewish reporting and historiography themselves guide us, decisively asserting that the idea of a single God was brought to the people by Moses. If there is an objection to the credibility of this assertion, it is that the priestly editing of the texts we have today attributes far too much to Moses. Institutions like ritual prescriptions, which clearly belong to later times, are presented as Mosaic commandments to lend them authority. This certainly gives us reason for suspicion, but not enough for outright rejection. The deeper motive behind such exaggeration is evident. The priestly narrative aims to establish a continuum between their present and Mosaic times, deliberately denying what we have identified as the most striking fact of Jewish religious history: the gap between the legislation of Moses and the later Jewish religion, initially filled by the worship of Yahweh and only gradually bridged over time. They deny this process by all means, although its historical accuracy is beyond doubt, given the abundant evidence remaining in the biblical text despite its special treatment. The priestly editing attempted something similar to the distorting tendency that made the new God Yahweh the God of the patriarchs. Considering this motive of the priestly code, it becomes hard to disbelieve the claim that Moses indeed introduced the monotheistic idea to the Jews. Our agreement becomes easier since we know where Moses got this idea from, something the Jewish priests likely did not know.

One might then ask, what do we gain by tracing Jewish monotheism back to Egyptian origins? The problem is merely shifted; we still do not know more about the genesis of the monotheistic idea. The answer is that it is not about gain, but about research. And perhaps we will learn something if we discover the actual course of events.

**Latent Period and Tradition**

I affirm the belief that the idea of a single God, the rejection of magical rituals, and the emphasis on ethical demands in his name were indeed Mosaic teachings. These teachings initially found no acceptance but, after a long interim period, eventually took effect and became established permanently. How can we explain such a delayed effect, and where do we encounter similar phenomena?
The next thought suggests that such phenomena are not uncommon and can arise in various fields in many different ways, some more understandable than others. Let's consider, for example, the fate of a new scientific theory like Darwin's theory of evolution. Initially, it faces fierce rejection and is hotly debated for decades, but it usually takes no more than a generation for it to be recognized as a significant step towards the truth. Darwin himself achieves the honor of a grave or cenotaph in Westminster Abbey. This case leaves little to unravel. The new truth has sparked emotional resistance, which can be supported by arguments that challenge the evidence in favor of the unwelcome theory. The battle of opinions takes some time, with supporters and opponents from the start. The number and influence of the supporters grow until they eventually prevail. Throughout the entire period of conflict, the core issue is never forgotten. We are hardly surprised that the whole process takes a long time and probably do not appreciate enough that we are dealing with a phenomenon of mass psychology.

It's not difficult to find a parallel process in the inner life of an individual. This would be the case when someone encounters something new that they should recognize as true based on certain evidence but which contradicts some of their desires and offends some of their cherished beliefs. They will then hesitate, search for reasons to doubt the new information, and struggle with themselves for a while until they finally admit: it is indeed so, even though it is not easy to accept, even though it is uncomfortable to have to believe it. From this, we learn only that it takes time for the self's intellectual work to overcome objections held by strong emotional attachments. The similarity between this case and the one we are trying to understand is not very significant.
The next example we turn to seems to have even less in common with our problem. It happens that a person appears to leave the site of a traumatic accident, like a train collision, seemingly unharmed. However, in the following weeks, they develop a series of severe psychological and motor symptoms that can only be attributed to the shock or disturbance they experienced at that time. This condition is known as "traumatic neurosis." It's a completely baffling, and thus a new fact. The time between the accident and the onset of symptoms is called the "incubation period," a clear reference to the pathology of infectious diseases.

In retrospect, we must note that despite the fundamental differences between the two cases, there is a point of similarity between the problem of traumatic neurosis and that of Jewish monotheism. This similarity lies in what we could call the character of latency. According to our established understanding, there is a long period in Jewish religious history after the abandonment of Moses' religion during which the monotheistic idea, the rejection of ceremonial practices, and the overemphasis on ethics are not evident. Thus, we are led to consider the possibility that the solution to our problem lies in a specific psychological situation.
We have repeatedly described what happened in Qadeš when the two groups that would later form the Jewish people came together to adopt a new religion. Among those who had been in Egypt, the memories of the Exodus and the figure of Moses were still so strong and vivid that they demanded inclusion in a historical account of the past. These were likely the grandchildren of people who had known Moses personally, and some of them still felt Egyptian and bore Egyptian names. However, they had good reasons to suppress the memory of the fate that had befallen their leader and lawgiver. For the other group, the primary intent was to glorify the new god and deny his foreign origins. Both groups had a shared interest in denying any previous religion and its content.

This led to the first compromise, which likely soon found written form. The people from Egypt brought with them the skill of writing and an interest in recording history. However, it would take a long time before historiography recognized its duty to uncompromising truth. Initially, it had no qualms about shaping its reports according to its needs and tendencies, as if the concept of falsification had not yet occurred to it. Consequently, a contrast could develop between the written record and the oral tradition of the same material. What was omitted or altered in the written record could very well be preserved intact in the tradition. The tradition supplemented and simultaneously contradicted the historiography. It was less subject to distorting influences, perhaps in some respects entirely free from them, and therefore could be more truthful than the written account. However, its reliability suffered from being more unstable and vague than the written record, exposed to various changes and distortions as it was orally transmitted from one generation to the next.

Such a tradition could have different fates. Most likely, we would expect it to be overshadowed by the written record, unable to assert itself alongside it, becoming increasingly shadowy until it finally fades into oblivion. But other fates are possible as well; one of them is that the tradition itself ends up being written down, and we will discuss other possibilities as we proceed.

For the phenomenon of latency in Jewish religious history that concerns us, the explanation now presents itself that the facts and contents deliberately denied by the so-called official historiography were never truly lost. Knowledge of them lived on in traditions preserved among the people. According to Sellin, there was even a tradition about Moses' end that directly contradicted the official account and was much closer to the truth. The same, we can assume, applied to other elements that seemingly perished with Moses, including many aspects of Mosaic religion that were unacceptable to most of Moses' contemporaries.
The strange fact we encounter here is that these traditions, instead of fading over time, grew stronger with each passing century. They infiltrated later official reports and eventually became powerful enough to significantly influence the thoughts and actions of the people. The exact conditions that made this possible remain unknown to us for now.

This fact is so peculiar that we feel justified in revisiting it. Herein lies our problem. The Jewish people had abandoned the religion of atonement brought to them by Moses, turning instead to the worship of another god, not much different from the Baalim of neighboring peoples. Despite all efforts, later tendencies could not conceal this embarrassing reality. However, the religion of Moses did not vanish without a trace; a kind of memory of it persisted—perhaps a darkened and distorted tradition. This tradition of a grand past continued to exert influence from the background, gradually gaining more power over minds. It eventually succeeded in transforming Yahweh into the Mosaic God, reviving the long-abandoned religion of Moses. The idea that a lost tradition could have such a powerful effect on the collective psyche of a people is unfamiliar to us. We find ourselves in an area of mass psychology where we are not at ease. We look for analogies, for facts of at least a similar nature, even if found in different fields. We believe such facts can be found.

During the times when the revival of the Moses religion was being prepared among the Jews, the Greek people possessed an incredibly rich treasure of genealogical legends and hero myths. It is believed that in the 9th or 8th century, the two Homeric epics were created, drawing their material from this cycle of legends. With our current psychological insights, one could have questioned long before Schliemann and Evans: Where did the Greeks get all the mythological material that Homer and the great Attic dramatists used in their masterpieces? The answer would have been: This people likely experienced a period of external splendor and cultural flourishing in their prehistory, which ended in a historical catastrophe. This dark tradition survived in these myths. Modern archaeological research has confirmed this conjecture, which would certainly have been considered too bold at the time. It uncovered evidence of the magnificent Minoan-Mycenaean culture that likely came to an end on the Greek mainland before 1250 BCE. Greek historians of later periods scarcely mention it. They provide only a few remarks: that there was a time when the Cretans held naval supremacy, the name of King Minos, and his palace, the Labyrinth; beyond that, nothing remains except the traditions preserved by artists.
Epic poetry has also been discovered among other cultures, including the Germans, Indians, and Finns. It is up to literary historians to investigate whether their creation conditions were the same as those for the Greeks. I believe such an investigation will yield positive results. The condition we recognize is this: a piece of prehistory that immediately afterwards must have appeared rich in content, significant, and grand—possibly always heroic—but lies so far back in time and belongs to such distant eras that later generations only know it through vague and incomplete traditions. It's been noted with some surprise that the epic as an art form died out in later times. Perhaps the explanation is that its conditions could no longer be met. The old material had been exhausted, and for all subsequent events, historical writing had replaced tradition. Even the greatest heroic deeds of our time were unable to inspire an epic, but even Alexander the Great had a right to lament that he would not find a Homer.

Times long past hold a great, often mysterious attraction for the human imagination. Whenever people are dissatisfied with their present—which happens often enough—they turn back to the past, hoping to finally validate the never-extinguished dream of a golden age. This situation underpins Macaulay's Lays of Ancient Rome. He imagines himself as a singer, saddened by the current chaotic political strife, reminding his listeners of the self-sacrifice, unity, and patriotism of their ancestors. They likely remain under the spell of their childhood, which an impartial memory reflects as a time of unbroken bliss. When only incomplete and blurred memories of the past remain, which we call tradition, it particularly entices the artist. It allows them to fill the gaps in memory according to their imagination's desires and shape the image of the time they want to reproduce according to their intentions. One might almost say, the more indefinite the tradition has become, the more useful it becomes for the artist. Thus, we shouldn't be surprised by the importance of tradition for art, and the analogy to the conditions of the epic will make us more inclined to accept the unusual notion that it was the tradition of Moses among the Jews that transformed the worship of Yahweh in the sense of the old Mosaic religion. However, the two cases are still very different. There, the result is a work of art; here, it is a religion. We assume that the latter was faithfully reproduced under the influence of tradition, which the case of the epic obviously cannot demonstrate. Therefore, enough of our problem remains to justify the need for more fitting analogies.

<strong>C - The Analogy</strong>
The only satisfactory analogy to the peculiar process we've identified in Jewish religious history is found in a seemingly unrelated field. However, it is very comprehensive and comes close to being identical. Here, we encounter the phenomenon of latency, the emergence of puzzling phenomena requiring explanation, and the condition of early, later forgotten experiences. Additionally, there's the characteristic of compulsion, which overwhelms logical thinking and imposes itself on the psyche—a trait not considered in the genesis of the epic.

This analogy is found in psychopathology regarding the genesis of human neuroses, thus belonging to the field of individual psychology. In contrast, religious phenomena naturally belong to mass psychology. It will become apparent that this analogy is not as surprising as one might initially think; in fact, it corresponds more closely to a fundamental assumption.

The early experienced, later forgotten impressions, to which we attribute significant importance in the etiology of neuroses, we call traumas. Whether the etiology of neuroses in general can be considered traumatic remains debatable. The obvious objection is that in many cases, no evident trauma can be singled out from the early history of the neurotic individual. Often, one must modestly state that nothing more is present than an extraordinary, abnormal reaction to experiences and demands that affect all individuals and are processed and resolved by them in other, typically normal ways. Where only hereditary and constitutional predispositions are available for explanation, it is understandably tempting to say that the neurosis is not acquired but developed.
In this context, two points stand out. First, the genesis of neurosis always traces back to very early childhood experiences. Therefore, it's absurd to claim to practice psychoanalysis while excluding these early periods from investigation and consideration, as some do. Secondly, it's true that there are cases labeled as "traumatic" because the effects clearly stem from one or more intense early impressions that have not been properly resolved. One might argue that if these events had not occurred, the neurosis would not have developed. 

For our purposes, it would suffice if we only had to restrict the sought-after analogy to these traumatic cases. However, the gap between the two groups of cases does not seem insurmountable. It's quite possible to combine both etiological conditions into one understanding; it all depends on how we define "traumatic." If we assume that an experience becomes traumatic due to a quantitative factor—meaning that the issue lies in an excess of demand causing the experience to provoke unusual, pathological reactions—then we can easily conclude that what acts as trauma for one person may not have the same effect on another. 

This leads to the idea of a sliding "complementary series," where two factors come together to fulfill the etiology. A deficiency in one factor is compensated by an excess in another, generally resulting in their interaction, and only at the ends of this series can we speak of a simple motivation. According to this consideration, we can dismiss the distinction between traumatic and non-traumatic etiology as irrelevant for the analogy we seek.

Despite the risk of repetition, it may be useful to summarize the facts that contain the analogy significant to us. They are as follows: Our research has shown that what we call the phenomena (symptoms) of neurosis are consequences of certain experiences and impressions, which we thus recognize as etiological traumas. We now have two tasks: first, to identify the common characteristics of these experiences, and second, to investigate the characteristics of neurotic symptoms, where certain generalizations can be allowed.
### Early Childhood Trauma and Its Implications

**a)** All these traumas occur in early childhood, up to around 5 years of age. Impressions from the time when language starts to develop stand out as particularly interesting. The period from 2-4 years seems to be the most crucial. It is uncertain exactly when this period of susceptibility begins after birth. 

**b)** These experiences are usually completely forgotten and are not accessible to memory, falling into the period of infantile amnesia. This amnesia is typically interrupted by isolated memory fragments, known as screen memories.

**c)** The experiences involve sexual and aggressive impressions, as well as early damage to the self (narcissistic injuries). It is important to note that very young children do not sharply distinguish between sexual and purely aggressive actions as they do later (a sadistic misunderstanding of the sexual act). The prominence of sexual elements is particularly striking and demands theoretical consideration.

These three points—occurrence within the first 5 years, forgetfulness, and the sexual-aggressive content—are closely interconnected. The traumas are either experiences involving the child's own body or sensory perceptions, mostly of things seen and heard, thus they are either experiences or impressions. The connection between these three points is established through a theory derived from analytical work, which can provide knowledge of these forgotten experiences. More vividly, though less accurately stated, this theory can bring them back into memory. The theory proposes that, contrary to popular belief, human sexuality—or what corresponds to it later in life—shows an early peak that ends around 5 years old. This is followed by a latency period—until puberty—during which no further sexual development occurs, and what has been achieved may even regress.

This theory is supported by anatomical studies of the growth of the internal genitalia. It leads to the hypothesis that humans may descend from a species that became sexually mature at 5 years old. It also suggests that the delay and two-stage onset of sexual life are intimately connected with human evolution. Humans appear to be the only species with such a latency and delay in sexual maturation. Studies on primates, which to my knowledge do not yet exist, would be essential to test this theory.

Psychologically, it is significant that the period of infantile amnesia coincides with this early phase of sexuality. This fact might provide the real condition for the possibility of neurosis, which in a certain sense is a human privilege. In this view, neurosis appears as a survival from ancient times, similar to certain elements in our body's anatomy.
### Common Traits or Peculiarities of Neurotic Phenomena

There are two key points to highlight:

**1. Positive and Negative Effects of Trauma:**

**a) Positive Effects:** The effects of trauma can be divided into positive and negative categories. The positive effects include efforts to bring the trauma back into focus, to remember the forgotten experience, or even better, to re-experience it. This could involve reliving an earlier emotional connection with another person in a similar relationship. These efforts are known as fixation on the trauma and the compulsion to repeat. These tendencies can be integrated into the so-called normal self and become permanent traits, even though the actual reason for their existence—their historical origin—has been forgotten. For example, a man who spent his childhood excessively attached to his mother (a now forgotten bond) might spend his entire life seeking a woman on whom he can depend, who will nurture and sustain him. Similarly, a girl who was sexually seduced in early childhood might later shape her sexual life around provoking similar attacks repeatedly. It's easy to see that such insights extend beyond the problem of neurosis, offering a deeper understanding of character formation in general.

**b) Negative Reactions:** These aim for the opposite goal: to prevent any memory or repetition of the forgotten traumas. We can group these as defensive reactions. Their primary expression is avoidance behaviors, which can escalate into inhibitions and phobias. These negative reactions also significantly shape character; fundamentally, they are as much fixations on the trauma as their opposites, but with opposing tendencies. The symptoms of neurosis, in a narrower sense, are compromise formations where both types of trauma-driven tendencies converge, resulting in a dominant expression of one direction or the other at different times. This opposition in reactions creates conflicts that typically cannot be resolved.

By understanding these dynamics, we gain insights into both the development of neuroses and the overall process of character formation.
All these phenomena—symptoms, limitations of the self, and stable character changes—have a compulsive nature. This means that when they are very intense, they show significant independence from the organization of other mental processes that are adapted to the demands of the external world and follow the laws of logical thinking. They are not, or not sufficiently, influenced by external reality. They disregard it and its psychological representation, often coming into active conflict with both. They are like a state within a state, an inaccessible and uncooperative faction, yet one that can manage to overpower the so-called normal part and force it into service. When this happens, it signifies the dominance of an internal psychic reality over the reality of the outside world, paving the way for psychosis. Even when it doesn’t go that far, the practical significance of these dynamics is hard to overestimate. The life inhibition and incapacity of individuals dominated by a neurosis is a very significant factor in human society, and one can see it as a direct expression of their fixation on an early part of their past.
And now we ask, what is it about latency that must particularly interest us in light of the analogy? A childhood trauma can directly lead to a neurotic outburst, resulting in a childhood neurosis filled with efforts at defense and the formation of symptoms. This neurosis can persist for some time, causing noticeable problems, but it can also remain latent and go unnoticed. Typically, the defenses dominate during this period; in any case, changes to the self, comparable to scar formations, remain. It's rare for a childhood neurosis to continue uninterrupted into adult neurosis. More often, it is followed by a period of seemingly uneventful development, a process supported or enabled by the physiological latency period. Only later does the transformation occur, with the final neurosis manifesting as a delayed effect of the trauma. This happens either with the onset of puberty or a bit later. In the former case, the drives, now strengthened by physical maturation, can resume the battle they initially lost to defense mechanisms. In the latter case, the reactions and self-changes established during defense now hinder the resolution of new life tasks, leading to intense conflicts between the demands of the external world and the self, which strives to maintain its hard-won organization from the defense struggle. The phenomenon of a latency period between the initial reactions to the trauma and the later outbreak of the disorder must be recognized as typical. This disorder can also be seen as an attempt at healing, an effort to reconcile the parts of the self split off by the trauma and to integrate them into a unified whole capable of handling external reality. However, such an attempt rarely succeeds without the aid of analytic work, and even then, success is not guaranteed. It often ends in a complete devastation and fragmentation of the self or its overwhelming by the early split-off part dominated by the trauma.

To convince the reader, a detailed account of numerous neurotic life histories would be required. However, given the complexity and breadth of the subject, this would completely change the nature of this work. It would turn into a treatise on the theory of neuroses, likely resonating only with the small minority who have chosen the study and practice of psychoanalysis as their life's work. Since I am addressing a broader audience here, I can only ask the reader to grant a certain preliminary credibility to the abbreviated explanations provided above, with the understanding that the conclusions I lead you to should only be accepted if the underlying teachings prove to be correct.

I can at least try to recount a single case that particularly highlights some of the mentioned peculiarities of neurosis. Of course, one should not expect a single case to demonstrate everything, and one should not be disappointed if it deviates significantly from what we are seeking through analogy.
The little boy, who, as often happens in middle-class families, shared his parents' bedroom during his early years, had repeated, even regular, opportunities to observe the sexual activities between his parents at an age when he was barely able to speak. He saw many things and heard even more. In his later neurosis, which broke out immediately after his first spontaneous ejaculation, the earliest and most troublesome symptom was a sleep disorder. He became extraordinarily sensitive to nighttime noises and, once awakened, could not fall back asleep. This sleep disorder was a true compromise symptom: on one hand, it expressed his defense against those nighttime observations; on the other hand, it was an attempt to stay awake and listen to those impressions again.

Awakened early to aggressive masculinity through such observations, the child began to stimulate his small penis with his hand and attempted various sexual advances towards his mother, identifying with his father and putting himself in his place. This continued until he finally received a prohibition from his mother against touching his penis and further heard her threaten to tell his father, who would punish him by taking away the sinful organ. This threat of castration had an extraordinarily strong traumatic effect on the boy. He abandoned his sexual activities and changed his character. Instead of identifying with his father, he feared him, adopted a passive attitude towards him, and provoked him with occasional misbehavior that led to physical punishments, which had sexual significance for him, allowing him to identify with the abused mother. He clung to his mother more anxiously, as if he could not bear to be without her love for a moment, seeing it as protection against the threat of castration from his father. He spent the latency period in this modified version of the Oedipus complex, which remained free from noticeable disturbances. He became a model boy and did well in school.

So far, we have traced the immediate impact of the trauma and confirmed the fact of latency.

The onset of puberty brought about the manifest neurosis and revealed its second main symptom, sexual impotence. He had lost the sensitivity of his penis, did not attempt to touch it, and did not dare to approach a woman with sexual intent. His sexual activity remained confined to psychological masturbation with sadomasochistic fantasies, in which one can easily recognize the remnants of those early observations of his parents' intercourse. The surge of increased masculinity that puberty brought was directed towards intense hatred and defiance against his father. This extreme, self-destructive relationship with his father also caused his failure in life and his conflicts with the outside world. He was unable to succeed in his profession because his father had forced him into it. He also did not make any friends and never had good relationships with his superiors.
When, burdened with these symptoms and incapacities, he finally found a wife after his father's death, core traits of his personality emerged that made interacting with him a challenging task for everyone close to him. He developed an absolutely selfish, despotic, and brutal personality, seemingly driven by a need to oppress and hurt others. He became a faithful copy of his father, as his memory had shaped the father's image — essentially a resurgence of the father-identification that the little boy had once adopted for sexual reasons. In this, we recognize the return of the repressed, which we have described as one of the key features of a neurosis, alongside the immediate effects of trauma and the phenomenon of latency.

<strong>Application</strong>

Early trauma – defense – latency – outbreak of the neurotic disorder – partial return of the repressed: this is the formula we have established for the development of a neurosis. The reader is now invited to consider that similar events may have occurred in the life of humanity as in the life of individuals. This means that there have also been events of a sexually-aggressive nature, which left lasting effects but were mostly suppressed and forgotten, only to resurface after a long period of latency, producing phenomena structurally and thematically similar to symptoms.

I believe we can infer these events and want to show that their symptom-like consequences are the religious phenomena. Since the emergence of the idea of evolution, it has become indisputable that humankind has a prehistory, and as this prehistory is unknown—meaning forgotten—such a conclusion has the weight of a postulate. If we find that the effective and forgotten traumas relate to life within the human family, both historically and individually, we will welcome this as an unexpected, highly desirable addition, not previously required by our discussions.

I made these claims a quarter of a century ago in my book *Totem and Taboo* (1912–13) and need only repeat them here. The construction is based on a statement by Charles Darwin and includes a hypothesis by John Atkinson. It suggests that in primeval times, early humans lived in small hordes, each under the dominion of a strong male. The exact time cannot be specified, nor can it be linked to known geological epochs. It's likely that early humans had not yet made significant progress in language development. An essential piece of this construction is the assumption that the described fates affected all early humans, and therefore all our ancestors.
The story is narrated with great compression, as if a single event took place, when in reality it spanned millennia and was repeated countless times over that long period. The dominant male was the lord and father of the entire horde, wielding unlimited power that he used violently. All the females were his property—the women and daughters of his own group, and possibly those captured from other hordes. The fate of the sons was harsh; if they aroused their father's jealousy, they were killed, castrated, or driven away. They had to live in small groups and acquire women through raids, where some managed to rise to a position similar to that of their father in the primal horde. The youngest sons had a unique position due to natural reasons—they were protected by their mother's love and could benefit from their father's aging, eventually replacing him after his death. We believe we can detect echoes of both the expulsion of the older sons and the favoring of the youngest in myths and fairy tales.

The next crucial step in changing this initial type of "social" organization was when the banished brothers, living in community, banded together, overpowered their father, and, following the customs of those times, consumed him raw. This act of cannibalism shouldn't be shocking—it extends far into later times. What's essential is that we attribute to these early humans the same emotional attitudes that we can observe in the primitives of today and in our children through analytical research. Thus, they not only hated and feared the father but also revered him as a role model, with each one secretly wanting to take his place. The act of cannibalism then becomes understandable as an attempt to ensure identification with the father by incorporating a part of him.
After the killing of the father, it's likely that a prolonged period followed where the brothers fought among themselves for the inheritance, each wanting to claim it for himself. Realizing the dangers and futility of these conflicts, recalling their shared act of liberation, and their emotional bonds formed during the times of exile, they eventually reached an agreement—a kind of social contract. This led to the first form of social organization with the renunciation of certain drives, recognition of mutual obligations, and the establishment of specific, inviolable institutions—essentially the beginnings of morality and law. Each individual gave up the ideal of achieving the father’s position for themselves and the possession of the mother and sisters. Thus, the incest taboo and the commandment of exogamy were established. A significant portion of the power vacated by the father’s removal shifted to the women, ushering in the era of matriarchy. The memory of the father persisted during this period of the "brotherhood." A powerful animal, perhaps initially feared, was chosen as a father substitute. This choice might seem odd to us, but the gap that humans later created between themselves and animals did not exist for primitive people, nor does it for our children, whose animal phobias we understand as fear of the father. The ambivalence of the original emotional relationship with the father was fully maintained in the relationship to the totem animal. The totem was considered both a physical ancestor and the clan's guardian spirit, deserving of reverence and protection. However, a festival day was established where the totem animal met the same fate as the original father—it was killed and consumed by all the members together (the totem meal, as described by Robertson Smith). This great festival day was, in reality, a celebration of the sons' victory over the father.

Where does religion fit into this context? I believe we have every right to see totemism—with its worship of a father substitute, the ambivalence expressed in the totem meal, the establishment of commemorative ceremonies, and taboos whose violation is punished by death—as the first form of religion in human history. This confirms its intrinsic connection with social structures and moral obligations from the very beginning. The further development of religion can only be briefly covered here. These developments undoubtedly parallel the cultural progress of humankind and the changes in the structure of human communities.
The next development from totemism is the humanization of the revered being. Instead of animals, human gods emerge, whose origins from the totem are not hidden. These gods might still be depicted in animal form or at least with the animal’s face, or the totem becomes the preferred companion of the god, inseparable from them. Sometimes, the myth has the god slaying the animal, which was only a precursor to the god. At a not easily identifiable point in this evolution, great mother goddesses appear, likely even before male gods, and they coexist for a long time. Meanwhile, a significant social upheaval occurred. Matriarchy was replaced by a reinstated patriarchal order. The new fathers never achieved the omnipotence of the primal father; there were many of them living together in larger groups than the previous horde. They had to get along with each other and were limited by social regulations. Mother goddesses likely emerged during the decline of matriarchy as compensation for the marginalized mothers. Male gods initially appear as sons beside the great mothers, only later taking on clear fatherly traits. These male gods of polytheism reflect the circumstances of the patriarchal era. They are numerous, limit each other, and occasionally subordinate to a superior chief god. The next step, however, leads to the theme that concerns us here: the return of a single, all-powerful father god.

It must be admitted that this historical overview is incomplete and uncertain in many points. However, anyone who dismisses our reconstruction of prehistory as merely fantastical would severely underestimate the richness and evidentiary power of the material incorporated into it. Large portions of the past, which are connected here into a whole, are historically documented, such as totemism and men’s societies. Other aspects have been preserved in excellent replicas. Several authors have noted how faithfully the ritual of the Christian communion, where the believer symbolically partakes of the body and blood of their god, repeats the sense and content of the ancient totem meal. Numerous remnants of the forgotten ancient times have been preserved in the myths and folk tales of people, and the analytical study of childhood psychology has provided an unexpectedly rich source of material to fill the gaps in our knowledge of ancient times. To contribute to the understanding of the significant father relationship, I only need to mention animal phobias, the peculiar fear of being eaten by the father, and the immense intensity of castration anxiety. There is nothing in our construction that is freely invented or lacking a solid foundation.

If we accept our portrayal of prehistory as generally credible, we recognize two elements in religious teachings and rituals: on the one hand, fixations on the old family history and its remnants; on the other hand, restorations of the past, the return of the forgotten after long intervals. The latter element, which has been overlooked and thus not understood, is what I intend to demonstrate here through at least one impressive example.
It is particularly noteworthy that every piece that emerges from oblivion asserts itself with extraordinary power, exerts an incomparably strong influence on the masses, and makes an irresistible claim to truth against which logical objections are powerless. This phenomenon is akin to the idea of "I believe because it is absurd." This peculiar character can only be understood by comparing it to the delusions of psychotics. I have long understood that within a delusional idea lies a fragment of forgotten truth, which must endure distortions and misunderstandings upon its reemergence. The compulsive conviction that accompanies delusion originates from this core of truth and extends to the surrounding errors. We must also acknowledge such a core of historical truth in the dogmas of religions, which, although they bear the character of psychotic symptoms, are exempt from the curse of isolation as mass phenomena.

No other aspect of religious history has become as transparent to us as the establishment of monotheism in Judaism and its continuation in Christianity, if we set aside the similarly comprehensible development from animal totem to human god with its regular companion. (Each of the four Christian evangelists has their favorite animal.) If we preliminarily accept the pharaonic world dominion as the catalyst for the emergence of the monotheistic idea, we see that this idea, detached from its original soil and transferred to another people, seizes this people after a long period of latency. It is cherished as their most precious possession and, in turn, sustains the people by bestowing upon them the pride of being the chosen ones. It is the religion of the forefather, to which hopes of reward, distinction, and ultimately world dominion are attached. This latter fantasy, long abandoned by the Jewish people, still persists today among their enemies in the belief in the conspiracy of the "Elders of Zion." In a later section, I will explain how the specific characteristics of the monotheistic religion borrowed from Egypt influenced the Jewish people and permanently shaped their character through the rejection of magic and mysticism, the encouragement of intellectual progress, and the call for sublimation. This possession of truth, the overwhelming consciousness of being chosen, led to an appreciation of intellectualism and an emphasis on ethics. Furthermore, the unfortunate fates and real disappointments faced by this people could only reinforce these tendencies. For now, let us pursue the development in another direction.
The reinstatement of the primal father to his historical rights was a significant advancement, but it couldn't be the end. Other elements of the prehistoric tragedy also sought recognition. It's not easy to guess what triggered this process. It seems that a growing sense of guilt had gripped the Jewish people, and perhaps the entire cultural world of that time, as a precursor to the return of repressed content. Eventually, one person from the Jewish community found the justification in the actions of a political-religious agitator, leading to the emergence of a new religion, Christianity, which separated itself from Judaism. Paul, a Roman Jew from Tarsus, tapped into this sense of guilt and traced it back to its prehistoric origins. He referred to it as "original sin," a crime against God that could only be atoned for by death. With original sin, death had entered the world. In reality, this crime worthy of death was the murder of the later deified primal father. However, what was remembered was not the act of murder but rather its atonement, and thus this fantasy could be welcomed as a message of redemption (Gospel). A son of God had allowed himself to be killed as an innocent, thereby taking on the guilt of everyone. It had to be a son because it had been a murder of the father. Probably, traditions from Oriental and Greek mysteries influenced the development of the redemption fantasy. The essential part of it seems to have been Paul's own contribution. He was a deeply religious person; the dark traces of the past lurked in his soul, ready to break through into more conscious regions.
That the Redeemer sacrificed himself without guilt was an obviously biased distortion that posed logical difficulties. How can someone innocent of the murder take on the guilt of the murderers by allowing themselves to be killed? In historical reality, such a contradiction did not exist. The "Redeemer" could only have been the main culprit, the leader of the brotherhood that overpowered the father. Whether such a chief rebel and leader existed must, in my opinion, remain undecided. It is quite possible, but one must also consider that each member of the brotherhood surely wished to commit the act alone, thereby creating a unique position for themselves and a replacement for the father identification that had to be given up within the community.

If there was no such leader, then Christ is the heir to an unfulfilled wish fantasy. If there was, then he is the successor and reincarnation of that leader. Regardless of whether this is fantasy or the return of a forgotten reality, the origin of the notion of the hero can be found here— the hero who always rebels against the father and kills him in some form. Ernest Jones points out that the god Mithras, who kills the bull, might represent this leader who boasts of his deed. It is well known how long the worship of Mithras competed with early Christianity for ultimate victory.

This also explains the otherwise difficult-to-prove "tragic guilt" of the hero in drama. It is hardly doubtful that the hero and the chorus in Greek drama represent this same rebellious hero and the brotherhood. It is also significant that in the Middle Ages, theater began again with the depiction of the Passion story.
I have already mentioned that the Christian ceremony of Holy Communion, where the believer consumes the blood and flesh of the Savior, echoes the content of the ancient totem meal. However, it does so only in its tender, reverential sense, not in its aggressive aspect. The ambivalence that governs the father relationship is evident in the ultimate outcome of this religious innovation. Supposedly aimed at reconciling with the father god, it ultimately led to his dethronement and removal. Judaism had been a father religion, while Christianity became a son religion. The old father god receded behind Christ, the Son, who took his place, just as every son in ancient times had longed for. Paul, who continued Judaism, also became its destroyer. His success was primarily due to the notion of redemption addressing humanity's guilt, but also because he abandoned the idea of the chosen people and its visible sign, circumcision. This allowed the new religion to become universal, encompassing all people. While Paul's personal vengefulness against the opposition his innovation faced in Jewish circles might have played a role, this step restored a characteristic of the old Aton religion and lifted a restriction it had acquired when it transitioned to the Jewish people.

In many respects, the new religion represented a cultural regression compared to the older Jewish religion, as often happens when new masses of people at a lower cultural level are admitted. Christianity did not maintain the level of spiritualization that Judaism had achieved. It was no longer strictly monotheistic, adopting numerous symbolic rites from surrounding peoples, reinstating the great mother goddess, and finding room for many polytheistic deities in transparent disguises, albeit in subordinate roles. Most notably, it did not, like the Aton religion and the subsequent Mosaic religion, shut itself off from the intrusion of superstitious, magical, and mystical elements, which would significantly hinder intellectual development for the next two millennia.

The triumph of Christianity was akin to a renewed victory of the priests of Amun over the god Ikhnaton after a 1,500-year interval and on a broader stage. And yet, in terms of the return of the repressed, Christianity was a religious-historical advancement, while from that point on, the Jewish religion became somewhat of a fossil.
It is worth understanding how the monotheistic idea made such a profound impression on the Jewish people and why they clung to it so tenaciously. I believe this question can be answered. Fate brought the Jewish people closer to the great deed and crime of ancient times, the killing of the father, by causing them to repeat it with Moses, a prominent father figure. This was a case of "acting out" instead of remembering, a phenomenon often observed during psychoanalytic work with neurotics. In response to Moses' teachings, which encouraged them to remember, they denied their action, continued to acknowledge the great father figure, and thus blocked access to the point where Paul would later continue the ancient history. It is hardly coincidental that the violent killing of another great man also became the starting point for Paul's religious reformation. This man, held by a small group of followers in Judea to be the Son of God and the promised Messiah, also had a piece of Moses' childhood story attributed to him. In reality, we know as little about him as we do about Moses. We do not know if he was the great teacher depicted in the Gospels or if the fact and circumstances of his death were decisive for the significance his person gained. Paul, who became his apostle, did not know him personally.

The killing of Moses by his own people, as identified by Sellin from traces in tradition and strangely accepted by the young Goethe without any proof, becomes an indispensable part of our construction, a crucial link between the forgotten event of ancient times and its later reemergence in the form of monotheistic religions. It is an appealing hypothesis that the remorse for the murder of Moses fueled the wishful fantasy of the Messiah, who would return to bring redemption and the promised world domination to his people. If Moses was this first Messiah, then Christ became his substitute and successor. Thus, Paul could historically proclaim to the nations, "Behold, the Messiah has truly come; he has been slain before your eyes." There is also a piece of historical truth in the resurrection of Christ, for he was the returned primal father of the primitive horde, transfigured and taking the place of the father as the son.
The poor Jewish people, who persistently denied the murder of the father, have paid a heavy price over time. They were repeatedly accused: "You killed our God." This accusation holds truth when correctly interpreted. It translates in the context of religious history to: "You refuse to admit that you killed God (the original image of God, the primordial father, and his later incarnations)." An addition might state: "We did the same, but we admitted it, and we have been absolved since then." Not all accusations against the Jewish people by anti-Semitism can claim a similar justification. A phenomenon as intense and enduring as the hatred of Jews must naturally have more than one cause. We can guess a range of reasons: some are obvious and derived from reality, needing no interpretation; others are deeper, stemming from hidden sources, which we might recognize as specific motives.

Among the former, the accusation of being foreigners is the weakest, because in many places dominated by anti-Semitism today, Jews are among the oldest parts of the population or were there even before the current inhabitants. This is true, for example, for the city of Cologne, where Jews arrived with the Romans before it was occupied by Germanic tribes. Stronger reasons for anti-Semitism include the fact that Jews often live as minorities among other peoples. The collective identity of the masses needs hostility towards an external minority to complete itself, and the numerical weakness of these outsiders invites their suppression. 

However, two other characteristics of Jews are seen as unforgivable. First, their differences from their "host peoples" in certain respects. Not fundamentally different, as they are not alien Asians, as enemies claim, but mostly remnants of Mediterranean peoples and heirs of Mediterranean culture. Yet they are still different, often in indefinable ways, especially compared to Nordic peoples. The intolerance of the masses paradoxically expresses itself more strongly against small differences than against fundamental ones.

The second point, even more significant, is that Jews have defied all oppression. The most brutal persecutions have not succeeded in exterminating them. Instead, they have shown the ability to sustain themselves in economic life and, where allowed, to make valuable contributions to all cultural achievements.
### The Deeper Motives of Anti-Semitism

The deeper motives of anti-Semitism are rooted in ancient times, influencing the unconscious minds of people. I am prepared for the possibility that these claims might initially seem implausible. I assert that the jealousy towards the Jewish people, who considered themselves the firstborn, favored children of God the Father, has not yet been overcome by others, as if they had believed that claim. Furthermore, among the customs that set Jews apart, circumcision made an unpleasant, uncanny impression. This can be explained by its reminder of the dreaded castration and thus touches on a deeply buried piece of ancient history. 

Lastly, we should not forget one of the most recent motives in this series: all these peoples who stand out today for their anti-Semitism only became Christians in later historical periods, often forced through bloody means. One could say they are all "poorly baptized." Beneath a thin veneer of Christianity, they have remained what their ancestors were: adherents of a barbaric polytheism. They have not overcome their resentment towards the new religion imposed on them but have transferred it to the source from which Christianity came. The fact that the Gospels tell a story that took place among Jews and essentially only involves Jews has made this transfer easier for them. Their hatred of Jews is fundamentally a hatred of Christians, and it is no surprise that in the German National Socialist revolution, this intimate relationship between the two monotheistic religions finds such clear expression in the hostile treatment of both.


It might have been successful earlier to draw the analogy between neurotic processes and religious events, thereby pointing to the unexpected origin of the latter. In transferring this from individual to mass psychology, two difficulties arise, differing in nature and significance, which we must now address. The first is that we’ve only examined one case from the rich phenomenology of religions, shedding no light on the others. Regrettably, the author must admit that he can offer no more than this single example; his expertise is insufficient to complete the investigation. He can add from his limited knowledge that the case of the foundation of the Islamic religion appears to him as a shortened repetition of the Jewish one, mimicking it. It seems that the Prophet initially intended to fully adopt Judaism for himself and his people. The recovery of the one great primal ancestor significantly boosted the Arabs' self-awareness, leading to substantial worldly successes but also exhausting itself in those achievements. Allah showed far more gratitude to his chosen people than Yahweh did to his. However, the internal development of the new religion soon stagnated, perhaps because it lacked the depth that the murder of the religious founder caused in the Jewish case.

The seemingly rationalistic religions of the East are essentially ancestor worship and therefore stop at an early stage of reconstructing the past. If it's true that among primitive peoples today, the acknowledgment of a supreme being is the sole content of their religion, this can only be seen as a stunted religious development, comparable to the numerous cases of rudimentary neuroses observed in another domain. We lack the understanding to explain why development ceased in both instances. One must consider the individual talents of these peoples, the direction of their activities, and their overall social conditions as responsible. 

Moreover, a good rule of analytical work is to be content with explaining what exists and not to strive to explain what has not come to be.
The second difficulty in applying these concepts to mass psychology is far more significant because it raises a new, fundamental problem. The question arises: in what form does influential tradition exist within the life of peoples? This is a question that doesn't arise for individuals because, in their case, it is resolved by the existence of memory traces of the past in the unconscious.

Let's return to our historical example. We have attributed the compromise in Qadesh to the persistence of a powerful tradition among those who returned from Egypt. This case poses no problem. According to our assumption, such a tradition relied on the conscious memory of oral communications received by those living at the time from their ancestors, only two or three generations back, who were participants and eyewitnesses of the relevant events. But can we believe the same for the later centuries, that tradition always had a foundation in knowledge passed down normally from ancestor to grandchild? It's no longer possible to identify the individuals who preserved and transmitted such knowledge orally as we could in the earlier case.

According to Sellin, the tradition of Moses' murder was always present in priestly circles until it finally found its written expression, which alone allowed Sellin to infer its existence. But it could only have been known to a few—it was not common knowledge. And is that enough to explain its impact? Can such knowledge, held by a few, be attributed the power to so profoundly affect the masses once it becomes known to them? It seems more likely that within the uninformed masses, there must be something that is somehow related to and resonates with the knowledge of the few when it is expressed.

The assessment becomes even more challenging when we turn to an analogous case from prehistory. The existence of a primal father with known attributes and his fate has undoubtedly been forgotten over the millennia, and no oral tradition can be assumed as in the case of Moses. In what sense, then, can any tradition be considered? In what form could it have existed?

To make it easier for readers who are unwilling or unprepared to delve into a complicated psychological matter, I will present the conclusion of the following investigation first. I believe the agreement between the individual and the mass on this point is nearly perfect; even in the masses, the impression of the past remains in unconscious memory traces.
**Understanding Repressed Memories in the Individual**

When it comes to the individual, we believe we see things clearly. The memory trace of early experiences remains within the person, but in a particular psychological state. One could say that the individual has always known it, just as we are aware of repressed material. Through analysis, we have developed certain ideas, easily supported by evidence, about how something can be forgotten and later resurface. The forgotten material is not erased but merely "repressed." Its memory traces remain fresh but are isolated by "counter-investments." They cannot interact with other intellectual processes— they remain unconscious and inaccessible to awareness. 

It’s also possible that certain parts of the repressed material escape this process, remain accessible to memory, and occasionally surface in consciousness. Even then, they are isolated, like foreign bodies, disconnected from everything else. However, this is not always the case; repression can be complete, and for our further discussion, we will focus on this scenario.

The repressed content retains its drive and strives to reach consciousness. It achieves this under three conditions: 

1. When the strength of the counter-investment is reduced by illness affecting the self, or by a different distribution of investment energies within the self, as regularly occurs during sleep.
2. When the drive components attached to the repressed material are particularly intensified, with puberty being the best example.
3. When recent experiences at any time resemble the repressed material closely enough to awaken it. The recent experience is then amplified by the latent energy of the repressed content, which comes into effect with its help.

In none of these three cases does the previously repressed content emerge unchanged into consciousness. Instead, it always undergoes distortions, reflecting the influence of the not entirely overcome resistance from the counter-investment, the modifying influence of the recent experience, or both.

**Conscious vs. Unconscious Processes**

We have used the distinction between conscious and unconscious processes as a guiding principle. The repressed is unconscious. It would be a welcome simplification if this statement allowed for a reversal—if the difference between conscious (c) and unconscious (u) qualities coincided with the division between self-related and repressed. The existence of such isolated and unconscious elements in our psyche would be new and significant. In reality, it is more complicated. It is true that all repressed material is unconscious, but not everything belonging to the self is conscious. 

We become aware that consciousness is a fleeting quality that only temporarily adheres to a psychological process. Therefore, we must replace "conscious" with "capable of consciousness" for our purposes and call this quality "preconscious" (pc). We then more accurately say that the self is essentially preconscious (virtually conscious), but parts of the self are unconscious.
This last observation teaches us that the qualities we have relied on so far are not sufficient for navigating the complexities of the mind. We need to introduce another distinction, which is not qualitative but topographical, and, importantly, also genetic. In our understanding of the mind as an apparatus composed of various agencies, regions, and provinces, we now distinguish a region we call the self from another we call the id. The id is the older part, and the self has developed from it like a bark layer under the influence of the external world. Our primal drives operate in the id, and all processes in the id are unconscious. The self, as we have mentioned, aligns with the domain of the preconscious, containing parts that typically remain unconscious. The psychological processes in the id follow entirely different laws of operation and interaction than those in the self. In fact, it is the discovery of these differences that has led us to our new understanding and justifies it.

The repressed material belongs to the id and is subject to its mechanisms, differing only in terms of its origin. This differentiation occurs early on, while the self is developing from the id. During this development, some contents of the id are absorbed by the self and elevated to a preconscious state, while other parts remain unaffected by this translation and stay as the true unconscious within the id. As the self continues to form, certain psychological impressions and processes within it are excluded through a defense process; they lose their preconscious character and are demoted to components of the id. This is what we refer to as the "repressed" in the id. Regarding the interaction between these two mental provinces, we assume that, on one hand, unconscious processes in the id can be elevated to the level of the preconscious and integrated into the self, and on the other hand, preconscious elements in the self can take the reverse path and be relegated back to the id. It is beyond our current focus that later on, a distinct region within the self, the "above-self," is delineated.
This might all seem far from simple, but once you're comfortable with the unfamiliar spatial concept of the mental apparatus, understanding it shouldn't pose any particular difficulties. I should add that the psychological framework developed here has nothing to do with brain anatomy and only touches on it at one point. The dissatisfaction with this idea, which I feel as clearly as anyone else, stems from our complete ignorance of the dynamic nature of mental processes. We tell ourselves that what distinguishes a conscious thought from a pre-conscious one, and a pre-conscious one from an unconscious one, can only be a modification, perhaps even a different distribution of mental energy. We talk about involvement and over-involvement, but beyond that, we lack any knowledge and even any basis for a useful working hypothesis. Regarding the phenomenon of consciousness, we can state that it is originally linked to perception. All sensations arising from the perception of pain, touch, hearing, or sight stimuli are most likely to be conscious. Thought processes and whatever might be analogous to them in the 'self' are inherently unconscious and gain access to consciousness through their association with memory traces of visual and auditory perceptions via the function of language. In animals, which lack language, these relationships must be simpler.

The impressions of early traumas, from which we started, are either not translated into the pre-conscious or are soon pushed back into the 'self' state through repression. Their memory traces are then unconscious and exert influence from the 'self'. We believe we can follow their further fate well as long as they pertain to personal experiences. However, a new complication arises when we consider the likelihood that the mental life of an individual may be influenced not only by personal experiences but also by inherent contents brought at birth, pieces of phylogenetic origin, an archaic heritage. This raises questions: what does this heritage consist of, what does it contain, what are its proofs?

The next and most certain answer is that it consists of certain dispositions, inherent to all living beings. For instance, the ability and tendency to follow particular developmental paths and to respond to certain stimuli, impressions, and excitations in a specific manner. Since experience shows that individual human beings exhibit differences in this regard, the archaic heritage includes these differences, representing what is recognized as the constitutional element in each individual. Given that all people experience roughly similar things at least in their early years, they react to them in similar ways, raising the question of whether these reactions, along with their individual differences, should be attributed to the archaic heritage. This doubt must be dismissed; the fact of this similarity does not enhance our knowledge of the archaic heritage.
However, analytical research has yielded individual results that give us pause. First, there is the universality of language symbolism. The symbolic representation of one object by another—this also applies to actions—is familiar and seemingly natural to all our children. We cannot explain how they learned it, and in many cases, we must admit that learning it is impossible. It involves an inherent knowledge that adults later forget. While adults use the same symbols in their dreams, they do not understand them unless the analyst interprets them, and even then, they are reluctant to believe the interpretation. When they use one of the common expressions in which this symbolism is evident, they must admit that the true meaning has completely eluded them. This symbolism transcends language differences; studies would likely show that it is universal, the same among all peoples. This seems to be a clear case of archaic inheritance from the time of language development, but another explanation could still be attempted. One might argue that these are thought connections between ideas that were established during historical language development and must be repeated each time an individual goes through language development. It would then be a case of inheriting a thinking disposition, much like inheriting a drive disposition, and not a new contribution to our problem.

Analytical work has also uncovered other findings that extend beyond the previous ones in their significance. When we study reactions to early traumas, we are often surprised to find that these reactions do not strictly adhere to what was actually experienced, but rather deviate in a way that aligns better with the model of a phylogenetic event and can only be explained by its influence. The behavior of the neurotic child towards their parents in the Oedipus and castration complexes is rich with such reactions, which seem individually unjustified and only become understandable phylogenetically, through the experiences of earlier generations. It would indeed be worthwhile to present this material, which I reference here, to the public in a collected form. Its evidentiary strength seems robust enough for me to take the further step of asserting that the archaic inheritance of humans includes not only dispositions but also contents—memory traces of the experiences of previous generations. This would significantly amplify both the scope and significance of archaic inheritance.
Upon closer reflection, I must admit that for a long time, I have behaved as though the inheritance of memory traces from our ancestors' experiences—independent of direct communication and the influence of upbringing by example—was not in question. When I speak of the persistence of an old tradition within a people or the formation of a national character, I often mean an inherited tradition rather than one passed down through communication. Or, at the very least, I have not distinguished between the two and have not realized the boldness of such oversight.

Our situation is complicated by the current stance of biological science, which dismisses the inheritance of acquired traits. However, I humbly acknowledge that this factor in biological development cannot be ignored. While these are not the same—one involves acquired traits that are difficult to grasp, the other involves memory traces of external impressions, more tangible—it seems that fundamentally, we cannot imagine one without the other. If we assume the persistence of such memory traces in our archaic heritage, we bridge the gap between individual and mass psychology and can treat nations like individual neurotics.

Admittedly, we do not currently have stronger evidence for these memory traces in our archaic heritage than the remnants of analytical work that require derivation from phylogenesis. However, this evidence seems strong enough to postulate such a reality. If it were otherwise, we would not make any progress in analysis or mass psychology along our current path. It is an unavoidable boldness.

By doing this, we also achieve something else. We reduce the gap that previous eras of human arrogance have excessively widened between humans and animals. If the so-called instincts of animals, which allow them to behave in a new life situation as if it were an old, familiar one, require any explanation, it can only be that they bring the experiences of their kind into their new existence, thus retaining memories of their ancestors' experiences. For humans, it would fundamentally be no different. The instincts of animals correspond to our own archaic heritage, even if it is of different scope and content.

After these considerations, I have no hesitation in stating that humans have always known—in that particular way—that they once had a primal father whom they both possessed and killed.
**Two further questions need to be answered here. First, under what conditions does such a memory enter the archaic heritage? Second, under what circumstances can it become active, that is, emerge from its unconscious state in the 'id' into consciousness, even if altered and distorted?**

**Answering the first question is straightforward: if the event was significant enough or occurred frequently enough, or both. In the case of the father's murder, both conditions are met.**

**Regarding the second question, several influences might come into play, not all of which need to be known. A spontaneous process is also conceivable, similar to what happens in certain neuroses. However, the reawakening of the forgotten memory trace through a recent real repetition of the event is undoubtedly crucial. Such a repetition was the murder of Moses; later, the supposed judicial murder of Christ, bringing these events to the forefront of the causation. It is as if the genesis of monotheism could not have occurred without these incidents. One is reminded of the artist's remark:**

**“What must fall in life to live eternally in song.” — Friedrich Schiller, "The Gods of Greece."**

**Finally, a psychological argument: A tradition based solely on communication could not produce the compulsion characteristic of religious phenomena. It would be heard, judged, and possibly dismissed like any other external news, never attaining the privilege of being freed from the constraints of logical thinking. It must first undergo repression, residing in the unconscious, before it can, upon its return, exert such powerful effects and captivate the masses as we have seen with religious traditions, which has astonished us and remained incomprehensible until now. This consideration weighs heavily in making us believe that the events indeed happened as we have tried to describe, or at least similarly.**

**PART TWO**
**SUMMARY AND REPETITION**

**The following part of this study cannot be presented to the public without extensive explanations and apologies. It is essentially a faithful, often verbatim repetition of the first part, shortened in some critical examinations and supplemented by additions related to the problem of how the unique character of the Jewish people emerged. I am aware that this manner of presentation is as impractical as it is unartistic. I unequivocally disapprove of it myself.**

**Why did I not avoid it? The answer is not difficult for me to find, but it is not easy to admit. I was unable to erase the traces of the rather unusual genesis of this work.**
In reality, it has been written twice. The first time was some years ago in Vienna, when I didn't believe I could publish it. I decided to let it be, but it haunted me like an unresolved spirit. I found a way out by turning two parts of it into independent pieces and publishing them in our journal, Imago: the psychoanalytic introduction of the whole (titled "Moses, an Egyptian") and the historical construction based on it ("If Moses was an Egyptian..."). The rest, which contained the truly controversial and dangerous parts—its application to the genesis of monotheism and the understanding of religion in general—I held back, thinking it would be forever.

Then, in March 1938, the unexpected German invasion forced me to leave my homeland. This also freed me from the concern that publishing it might provoke a ban on psychoanalysis where it was still tolerated. Soon after arriving in England, I found the temptation to share my withheld insights with the world irresistible. I began revising the third part of the study, connecting it to the two pieces that had already been published. This naturally involved partially rearranging the material. I couldn't fit all the content into this second version, and I couldn't bring myself to completely discard the earlier work. So, I connected an entire section from the first version to the second, resulting in significant repetition.

I could comfort myself with the thought that the subjects I address are so new and significant—regardless of whether my presentation of them is correct—that it's not a bad thing for the audience to read the same material twice. There are things that should be said more than once and cannot be said often enough. However, the reader should have the free choice to dwell on or revisit the topic. It shouldn't be sneaked in by presenting the same content twice in the same book. This remains a clumsiness for which I must accept criticism. An author's creative power doesn't always follow their will; the work turns out as it can and often appears to the creator as independent, even foreign.

**The People of Israel**
When one understands that a method like ours—accepting what seems useful from traditional material, discarding what doesn't work, and assembling the pieces according to psychological probability—does not guarantee finding the truth, it’s fair to ask why one would undertake such work at all. The answer lies in the results. By significantly relaxing the strict criteria for a historical-psychological investigation, it may become possible to clarify issues that have always seemed worthy of attention and have recently re-emerged due to recent events.

It is well-known that of all the ancient peoples who lived around the Mediterranean, the Jewish people are nearly the only ones who still exist today, both in name and substance. With unparalleled resilience, they have withstood misfortunes and mistreatment, developed distinctive characteristics, and, along the way, earned the strong dislike of all other peoples. One would like to understand better where this vitality of the Jews comes from and how their character is connected to their fate.

One can start with a characteristic of the Jews that dominates their relationship with others. There is no doubt that they have a particularly high opinion of themselves, considering themselves nobler, superior, and set apart from others by many of their customs. The frequent ancient slander that Jews were "lepers" (see Manetho) likely has the meaning of a projection: "They keep themselves so far from us, as if we were lepers." They are also imbued with a unique confidence in life, as if endowed by the secret possession of something precious, a kind of optimism; the devout might call it trust in God.
We know the reason for this behavior and understand their secret pride. They genuinely consider themselves God's chosen people, believing they have a special closeness to Him, which makes them proud and confident. Even in Hellenistic times, they reacted to good news just as they do today. The Jews were already set in their identity back then, and the Greeks, among whom they lived, reacted to Jewish distinctiveness in the same way that today's host nations do. It seems as if the Greeks also believed in the privilege that the people of Israel claimed for themselves. If one is the declared favorite of a feared father, one should not be surprised by the siblings' jealousy, and what this jealousy can lead to is beautifully illustrated by the Jewish story of Joseph and his brothers. The course of world history seemed to justify Jewish pride because when God later decided to send humanity a Messiah and Savior, He chose him again from the Jewish people. Other nations at that time could have said to themselves, "Indeed, they were right; they are God's chosen people." But instead, the salvation through Jesus Christ only intensified their hatred of Jews, while the Jews themselves gained no advantage from this second favor, as they did not recognize the Savior.

Based on our previous discussions, we can now assert that it was Moses who imprinted this significant trait on the Jewish people for all future. He boosted their self-esteem by assuring them that they were God's chosen people, imposed holiness on them, and obligated them to separate from others. It's not that other nations lacked self-esteem. Just like today, each nation back then considered itself better than the others. But Moses gave the Jews' self-esteem a religious foundation, making it a part of their faith. Through their special relationship with their God, they gained a share in His greatness. And since we know that behind the God who chose the Jews and freed them from Egypt stands the person of Moses, who did this supposedly on His behalf, we dare to say: It was the one man, Moses, who created the Jews. This people owe their resilience to him, as well as much of the hostility they have experienced and continue to experience.

**B - The Great Man**
How is it possible that a single person can exert such extraordinary influence that they shape indifferent individuals and families into a unified people, imprinting them with a definitive character and determining their fate for millennia? Isn't such an assumption a regression to the mindset that gave rise to creation myths and hero worship, to times when history writing was exhausted by reporting the deeds and fates of individual people, rulers, or conquerors? Modern tendencies lean more towards attributing historical events to hidden, general, and impersonal factors like the compelling influence of economic conditions, changes in diet, advances in the use of materials and tools, or migrations prompted by population growth and climate changes. In this view, individuals are merely seen as representatives or symbols of mass movements that necessarily had to find expression and did so more by chance through these people.

These perspectives are entirely valid, but they prompt us to acknowledge a significant discrepancy between our thinking and the structure of the world that our thinking seeks to grasp. Our compelling need for causality is satisfied when every event has a demonstrable cause. However, in reality, this is seldom the case; rather, every event seems to be overdetermined, presenting itself as the effect of multiple converging causes. Faced with the overwhelming complexity of events, our research tends to favor one connection over another, creating oppositions that don't truly exist but emerge from the fragmentation of broader relationships.

I protest against the misunderstanding that I am suggesting the world is so complex that every assertion must hold a piece of truth somewhere. No, our thinking has retained the freedom to discover dependencies and connections that correspond to nothing in reality, and it evidently values this ability highly, as it makes abundant use of it both within and outside of science. Therefore, if the investigation of a specific case proves the dominant influence of a single personality, we need not feel guilty for seemingly contradicting the doctrine of the importance of those general, impersonal factors. There is fundamentally room for both perspectives.

In the genesis of monotheism, however, we cannot point to any other external factor besides the already mentioned connection of this development with the establishment of closer relationships between different nations and the building of a great empire.
We thus preserve the "great man" his place in the chain, or rather the network, of causations. However, it might not be entirely useless to ask under what conditions we bestow this honorary title. It's surprising to find that answering this question isn't straightforward. An initial formulation—if a person possesses qualities we highly esteem to an exceptional degree—is clearly inaccurate in all directions. For example, beauty and muscular strength, no matter how envied, do not entitle someone to "greatness." Therefore, the qualities must be intellectual and psychological. 

However, we hesitate to call someone a great person simply because they excel in a particular field. Certainly not a chess master or a virtuoso musician, and even an outstanding artist or researcher is not easily given this title. In such cases, we are more inclined to say they are a great artist, painter, mathematician, or physicist—pioneers in their respective fields—but we withhold calling them a great person. When we unhesitatingly declare Goethe, Leonardo da Vinci, or Beethoven as great individuals, something more than admiration for their magnificent creations must be influencing us. 

If such examples were not in our way, one might think that the title "great man" is reserved mainly for men of action—conquerors, military leaders, rulers—recognizing the magnitude of their achievements and the strength of their influence. However, this is also unsatisfying and is fully contradicted by our condemnation of many worthless individuals who undeniably had an impact on their contemporaries and successors. We also cannot use success as a criterion for greatness, considering the many great individuals who, instead of succeeding, met a tragic end.

For now, one might lean towards the decision that it's not worthwhile to search for a precisely defined content for the concept of a "great man." It is merely a loosely used and rather arbitrary recognition of the exceptional development of certain human qualities, closely approximating the original meaning of "greatness." We should also remember that we are less interested in the essence of the great person than in how they influence their peers. However, we will abbreviate this investigation as much as possible, as it threatens to lead us far from our goal.
Let's accept that a great individual influences their peers in two ways: through their personality and through the idea they champion. This idea might emphasize an old collective desire, present a new goal, or captivate the masses in some other way. Sometimes—and this is likely the most original case—the personality alone has an impact, and the idea plays a minor role. Why should a great person gain significance at all? This is immediately clear to us. There's a strong need among people for an authority figure they can admire, submit to, be dominated by, and even mistreated by. From individual psychology, we've learned where this need stems from. It's the longing for a father figure, ingrained in everyone from childhood—the same father whom the hero of legend boasts of having overcome. 

And now, we might realize that all the traits we attribute to the great person are fatherly traits. This alignment reveals the essence of the great person that we've been seeking in vain. The decisiveness of thoughts, the strength of will, the power of actions—all belong to the father image. Most importantly, the independence and self-sufficiency of the great person, their godlike indifference, which can escalate to ruthlessness, are fatherly traits. We must admire them, trust them, but we cannot help also fearing them. We should have let the wording guide us; who else but the father could have been the "great man" of childhood?

Undoubtedly, it was a formidable father figure represented by Moses that descended to the poor Jewish laborers, assuring them that they were his beloved children. Equally overwhelming must have been the notion of a single, eternal, all-powerful God, who did not consider them too insignificant to form a covenant with and promised to care for them if they remained faithful to his worship. It was likely difficult for them to separate the image of Moses from that of his God, and they were right in their intuition. Moses might have projected traits of his own personality into the character of his God, such as anger and relentlessness. And when they eventually killed their great person, they were only repeating a crime that, in ancient times, had been directed against the divine king—a crime that, as we know, had an even older precedent.
If, on one hand, the figure of the great man has grown into the divine, it's time to remember that even the father was once a child. The grand religious idea that Moses represented, according to my findings, was not originally his; he inherited it from his king, Ikhnaton. And Ikhnaton, whose greatness as a religious founder is clearly documented, might have been influenced by ideas that reached him through his mother or other channels—from nearby or distant Asia.

We can't trace the chain further, but if these initial links are correctly identified, then the monotheistic idea boomeranged back to the land of its origin. It seems futile to try to credit a single individual for a new idea. Many evidently contributed to its development. On the other hand, it would be a blatant injustice to stop the chain of causation at Moses and neglect the contributions of his successors and continuers, the Jewish prophets. The seed of monotheism didn't flourish in Egypt. The same could have happened in Israel after the people cast off the burdensome and demanding religion. But repeatedly, men from the Jewish people arose to refresh the fading tradition, renew Moses' admonitions and requirements, and did not rest until what was lost was restored. Through centuries of continuous effort and finally through two major reforms—one before and one after the Babylonian exile—the transformation of the national god Yahweh into the God whose worship Moses imposed on the Jews was accomplished. This demonstrates a particular psychological aptitude in the masses that became the Jewish people, able to produce so many individuals willing to endure the hardships of Moses' religion for the reward of being chosen and possibly other prestigious rewards.

**C - The Advancement in Spirituality**
To achieve lasting psychological effects on a people, it’s evidently not enough to simply assure them that they are chosen by a deity. One must somehow prove it to them if they are to believe it and draw consequences from that belief. In the religion of Moses, the Exodus from Egypt served as this proof. God, or Moses in His name, tirelessly referred to this favor. The Passover festival was established to keep the memory of this event alive, or rather, an already existing festival was filled with the content of this memory. However, it was still just a memory; the Exodus belonged to a vague past. In the present, signs of God’s favor were quite sparse, and the fate of the people suggested His displeasure rather than goodwill. Primitive people often deposed or even punished their gods if they failed to grant them victory, happiness, and comfort. Kings have always been treated no differently from gods; this reveals an old identity, arising from a common root. Modern nations also tend to dethrone their kings when the glory of their reign is tarnished by defeats and related losses of land and money. But why the people of Israel clung even more submissively to their God the worse they were treated by Him remains a problem we must leave unresolved for now.

This might prompt us to investigate whether the religion of Moses brought the people anything other than an increased sense of self-worth through the consciousness of being chosen. The next factor is actually easy to identify. The religion also brought the Jews a far more magnificent conception of God, or, more soberly put, the idea of a more magnificent God. Anyone who believed in this God was, in a way, sharing in His greatness, allowing them to feel elevated themselves. This is not entirely self-evident to an unbeliever, but perhaps it can be understood better through the analogy of the pride felt by a Briton in a foreign country destabilized by unrest, a feeling completely absent in a citizen of a small continental state. The Briton counts on his government sending a warship if he is harmed, and that the insurgents are well aware of this, while the small state has no warship at all. The pride in the greatness of the British Empire thus also has a root in the awareness of greater security and protection that each Briton enjoys. This might be similar to the conception of the magnificent God, and since one can hardly claim to assist God in managing the world, the pride in God’s greatness merges with the pride in being chosen.
### The Prohibition of Imagery in Moses' Religion

Among the commandments of the religion of Moses, there is one that is more significant than it initially appears. It's the prohibition against making an image of God, essentially compelling the worship of an unseen deity. I suspect that Moses enforced this rule even more strictly than the Aton religion had—perhaps to be consistent. His God then had neither a name nor a face, which might have been a new measure against magical abuses. Accepting this prohibition, however, had profound effects. It meant prioritizing abstract thinking over sensory perception—a triumph of spirituality over sensuality, and strictly speaking, an emotional restraint with its psychologically necessary consequences.

To find this credible, which might not seem obvious at first glance, one must remember other similar developments in human culture. The earliest and perhaps the most important of these fades into the darkness of prehistory. Its astonishing effects compel us to assert its existence. In our children, in neurotic adults, and in primitive cultures, we find the psychological phenomenon we call the "belief in the omnipotence of thoughts." According to our understanding, this is an overestimation of the influence our mental, particularly intellectual, acts have on changing the external world. Fundamentally, all magic—the precursor to our technology—rests on this assumption. This also includes the magic of words and the conviction of the power associated with knowing and uttering a name. We assume that the "omnipotence of thoughts" was an expression of humanity's pride in the development of language, which significantly boosted intellectual activities. This opened up a new realm of spirituality, where ideas, memories, and reasoning became paramount, in contrast to the lower psychological activity centered on direct sensory perceptions. It was undoubtedly one of the most critical steps on the path to becoming human.

### The Shift from Matriarchal to Patriarchal Society

A more tangible example appears later in history. Influenced by external factors that we need not explore here and are partly unknown, matriarchal society was replaced by patriarchal society, naturally bringing a revolution in legal relations. One might still sense the echo of this revolution in Aeschylus's Oresteia. But this shift from mother to father also marks a victory of spirituality over sensuality and thus a cultural advancement. Maternity is proven by the evidence of the senses, while paternity is an assumption based on reasoning and supposition. Favoring intellectual processes over sensory perception proves to be a consequential step.
**The Evolution of Spirituality and the Impact of Mosaic Law**

At some point between the previously mentioned cases, another event occurred that closely parallels what I have studied in the history of religion. Humanity felt compelled to acknowledge "spiritual" forces—those that cannot be perceived by the senses, especially sight, but still exert undeniable and even overwhelming effects. If we trust the evidence of language, it was moving air that served as the prototype for spirituality. The word for spirit, in many languages, derives from wind or breath (animus, spiritus, Hebrew: ruach). This also led to the discovery of the soul as the spiritual principle within each person. Observations found this moving air in human breath, which ceases at death; even today, the dying person is said to exhale their soul. 

With this, the realm of spirits was opened to humanity. They were now ready to attribute the soul they had discovered within themselves to everything else in nature. The whole world became animated, and the science that came much later had a significant task in reintroducing a materialistic perspective—a task that is still unfinished today.

The Mosaic prohibition elevated God to a higher level of spirituality, paving the way for further modifications of the concept of God, which I will discuss later. But for now, let us focus on another effect of the same. All such advances in spirituality tend to enhance the self-esteem of individuals, making them feel proud and superior to those who remain under the influence of sensuality. We know that Moses instilled in the Jews the pride of being a chosen people; the dematerialization of God added a new, valuable piece to the people's hidden treasure. The Jews maintained their focus on spiritual interests, and the nation's political misfortunes taught them to appreciate the value of their only remaining possession—their scriptures. Immediately after the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem by Titus, Rabbi Yochanan ben Zakkai requested permission to open the first Torah school in Yavne. From then on, it was the Holy Scriptures and the intellectual effort surrounding them that kept the scattered people together.

This much is generally known and accepted. I wanted to add that this characteristic development of the Jewish identity was initiated by Moses' prohibition against worshiping God in a visible form.

The priority given to spiritual pursuits in the Jewish people's life for about 2,000 years has naturally had an impact; it helped curb the brutality and tendency toward violence that often arise when physical strength is the ideal. The harmony between intellectual and physical development, as achieved by the Greek people, was denied to the Jews. In this conflict, they at least chose the higher value.

**The Decision for Higher Values**
It's not immediately obvious or easy to understand why an advancement in intellect and a reduction in sensuality should boost the self-awareness of a person or a people. This seems to imply a certain value system and another person or entity that applies it. To clarify, let's look at a similar case from individual psychology, which we have come to understand.
When the id in a person demands an erotic or aggressive impulse, the simplest and most natural response is for the self, which has control over thinking and muscle actions, to satisfy it through an action. This satisfaction of the impulse is experienced by the self as pleasure, just as the unsatisfaction would undoubtedly be a source of displeasure. However, there can be instances where the self refrains from satisfying the impulse due to external obstacles, especially when it realizes that the action in question would pose a serious danger to itself. Refraining from satisfaction, or impulse renunciation in obedience to the reality principle, is never pleasurable. This renunciation would result in persistent displeasure unless the strength of the impulse could be reduced through energy shifts.

Impulse renunciation can also be enforced for other, more internal reasons. During personal development, part of the external inhibiting forces are internalized, creating within the self an entity that observes, criticizes, and forbids - which we call the above-self. From this point on, the self must consider not only the dangers of the external world but also the objections of the above-self before acting on the impulses demanded by the id, leading to more occasions where impulse satisfaction is withheld. While renunciation for external reasons is purely unpleasurable, renunciation for internal reasons, in obedience to the above-self, has a different economic effect. It brings the self not only the inevitable displeasure but also a gain in pleasure, a sort of substitute satisfaction. The self feels elevated and proud of the renunciation as if it were a valuable achievement.

We believe we understand the mechanism of this pleasure gain. The above-self is the successor and representative of the parents (and educators) who supervised the individual's actions during their early years. It continues their functions almost unchanged, keeping the self in constant dependency and exerting continuous pressure. The self, much like in childhood, is concerned with losing the love of this authority and feels its approval as liberation and satisfaction, its reproaches as guilt. When the self has made the sacrifice of an impulse renunciation to the above-self, it expects to be more loved by it as a reward. The consciousness of deserving this love is felt as pride.

In the time before the authority was internalized as the above-self, the relationship between the threat of losing love and the impulse demand could be the same. There was a sense of security and satisfaction when one renounced an impulse out of love for the parents. However, this good feeling could only take on the peculiar narcissistic character of pride once the authority itself became part of the self.
### Understanding the Role of Drive Renunciation in the Elevation of Intellectual Progress

What does the clarification of satisfaction through drive renunciation offer us in understanding the processes we aim to study, specifically the enhancement of self-awareness through intellectual progress? Apparently very little. The situations are quite different. This is not about drive renunciation, and there is no second person or entity for whom the sacrifice is made. The validity of the second claim will soon be questioned. One might argue that the great man himself is the authority for whom the achievement is accomplished. Given that the great man resembles the father, it is unsurprising that, in mass psychology, he assumes the role of the above-self. This could also apply to Moses in relation to the Jewish people. However, no proper analogy can be established in the other aspect.

Intellectual progress involves favoring higher intellectual processes over direct sensory perception. This includes memories, considerations, and reasoning. For example, determining that fatherhood is more important than motherhood, even though it cannot be proven by sensory evidence like motherhood can. That is why the child should take the father's name and inherit from him. Or, believing that our God is the greatest and most powerful, even though He is invisible, like the storm wind and the soul. Rejecting a sexual or aggressive drive seems entirely different from this.

Furthermore, in some advances in intellectuality, such as the triumph of paternal rights, there is no identifiable authority that sets the standard for what is considered higher. The father cannot be that authority in this case, as he is only elevated to authority through this progress. Thus, we face the phenomenon that, in human development, sensory perception is gradually overwhelmed by intellectuality, and people feel proud and elevated with each such progress. But why this should be so remains unclear. Later, it also happens that intellectuality itself is overwhelmed by the mysterious emotional phenomenon of faith. This is the famous Credo quia absurdum (I believe because it is absurd), and even those who achieve this see it as a great accomplishment.

Perhaps the common element in all these psychological situations is something else. Maybe humans simply regard the more difficult as the higher, and their pride is merely the narcissism heightened by the awareness of overcoming a difficulty.
These discussions may seem unproductive and unrelated to our investigation into what defines the character of the Jewish people. However, this could be an advantage for us. Yet, there is a certain connection to our problem, revealed by a fact that will occupy us later. The religion that began with the prohibition of making an image of God gradually evolved into a religion of drive renunciation. It doesn't demand sexual abstinence, but it does significantly restrict sexual freedom. God is completely removed from sexuality and elevated to the ideal of ethical perfection. Ethics, after all, is the restriction of drives. The prophets tirelessly remind the people that God demands nothing but a just and virtuous life, which means refraining from all drive satisfactions that our current morality also condemns as sinful. Even the demand to believe in God seems secondary to these serious ethical demands. Thus, drive renunciation appears to play a prominent role in religion, even if it wasn't present from the beginning.

However, there's room here for an objection to prevent a misunderstanding. Even if it seems that drive renunciation and the ethics based on it aren't essential to religion, they are genetically closely linked. Totemism, the first form of religion we recognize, includes a number of commands and prohibitions that essentially represent drive renunciations. These include the veneration of the totem, which includes the prohibition against harming or killing it, exogamy, which means renouncing the passionately desired mothers and sisters within the horde, and the concession of equal rights for all members of the brotherhood, which limits violent rivalry among them. These rules represent the first beginnings of moral and social order. We notice two different motivations here. The first two prohibitions align with the will of the deceased father, continuing his will; the third commandment, equal rights for the brotherhood, disregards the father's will and justifies itself by the necessity to maintain the new order established after the father's removal. Without this, a relapse into the previous state would have been inevitable. Here, social commandments diverge from the others, which, as we may say, directly stem from religious relationships.
In the shortened development of an individual, the essential part of this process repeats itself. Here, too, it is the authority of the parents, primarily that of the absolute, punishment-threatening father, that compels the child to give up certain instincts. This authority determines what is allowed and what is forbidden for the child. What the child considers "good" or "bad" will later, when society and the above-self replace the parents, be called "good" and "evil," virtuous or immoral. But it remains essentially the same: the renunciation of instincts under the pressure of an authority that continues and replaces the father.

These insights deepen further when we investigate the curious concept of sanctity. What stands out as "sacred" compared to other things we highly value and deem important? On one hand, the connection between the sacred and religion is unmistakable and heavily emphasized; everything religious is sacred, forming the very core of sanctity. On the other hand, our judgment is disrupted by numerous attempts to claim the character of sanctity for many other things—people, institutions, and practices—that have little to do with religion. These efforts serve obvious agendas. Let's start with the prohibitive nature that is so firmly attached to the sacred. The sacred is clearly something that must not be touched. A sacred prohibition is highly emotionally charged but lacks rational justification. For example, why should incest with a daughter or sister be considered a particularly heinous crime, much worse than any other sexual act? If one seeks a rational justification, they will likely hear that all our feelings rebel against it. But this simply means that the prohibition is taken for granted and cannot be justified.

The weakness of such an explanation is easily demonstrated. What supposedly offends our most sacred feelings was common practice in the ruling families of ancient Egyptians and other early civilizations, almost a sanctified custom. It was taken for granted that the Pharaoh's first and foremost wife would be his sister, and the later Greek Ptolemaic rulers did not hesitate to follow this example. This suggests rather that incest—in this case between brother and sister—was a privilege denied to ordinary mortals but reserved for the kings representing the gods. Similarly, Greek and Germanic myths did not find such incestuous relationships objectionable. One might suspect that the anxious preservation of equality in our high nobility is a remnant of this ancient privilege. Given the prolonged inbreeding over many generations, we can observe that today's highest social strata in Europe are ruled by members of just one or two families.
<strong>The Incest Taboo and Its Origins</strong>

The reference to incest among gods, kings, and heroes also helps dismiss another attempt to biologically explain the incest taboo, which attributes it to a deep-seated knowledge of the harm caused by inbreeding. However, it is not even certain that inbreeding poses a significant risk of harm, let alone that early humans recognized and reacted to such a threat. The uncertainty in determining permissible and forbidden degrees of kinship does not support the idea of a "natural feeling" as the fundamental basis of the incest taboo.

Our reconstruction of prehistory suggests a different explanation. The domain of exogamy, of which the incest taboo is a negative expression, was rooted in the will of the father and continued this will after his removal. This explains the strong emotional emphasis and the impossibility of a rational justification, thus its sanctity. I confidently expect that the investigation of all other cases of sacred prohibition would lead to the same conclusion as in the case of the incest taboo: that the sacred is originally nothing more than the continued will of the primal father. This also sheds light on the previously incomprehensible ambivalence of the words expressing the concept of sanctity. It is the ambivalence that governs the relationship with the father. "Sacer" means not only "holy" or "consecrated" but also something that we can only translate as "accursed" or "detestable" (as in "auri sacra fames" - the accursed hunger for gold). The will of the father was not only something untouchable and worthy of high honor but also something that evoked dread because it required painful renunciation of impulses. When we hear that Moses "sanctified" his people through the introduction of the practice of circumcision, we now understand the profound meaning of this claim. Circumcision is the symbolic substitute for castration, which the primal father once imposed on his sons from the fullness of his authority. Accepting this symbol indicated readiness to submit to the father's will, even if it demanded the most painful sacrifice.

<strong>Ethics and Its Foundations</strong>

Returning to ethics, I can conclude by saying: Part of its rules are rationally justified by the need to delineate the rights of the community against the individual, the rights of the individual against society, and those of individuals against each other. However, what appears grand, mysterious, and mystically self-evident in ethics owes these characteristics to its connection with religion, originating from the will of the father.

<strong>The Truth Content of Religion</strong>
How enviable those researchers who believe in the existence of a supreme being appear to us, the poor in faith! For this great spirit, the world has no problems because they themselves created all its institutions. How comprehensive, exhaustive, and definitive the teachings of believers are compared to the laborious, meager, and fragmented attempts at explanations, which are the best we can manage! The divine spirit, which is itself the ideal of ethical perfection, has instilled in humans the knowledge of this ideal and simultaneously the urge to align their essence with it. They feel directly what is higher and nobler and what is lower and baser. Their emotional life is tuned to their respective distance from the ideal. They experience great satisfaction when they, as if in perihelion, come closer to it, and they are severely punished with displeasure when they, as if in aphelion, move away from it. This is all so simple and unshakably fixed. We can only regret that certain life experiences and world observations make it impossible for us to accept the premise of such a supreme being. As if the world didn't already have enough riddles, we are now tasked with understanding how others acquired the belief in the divine being and where this belief draws its immense, "reason and science" overwhelming power from.

Let's return to the more modest problem that has occupied us so far. We wanted to explain the peculiar character of the Jewish people, which has probably enabled their preservation to this day. We found that the man Moses shaped this character by giving them a religion that elevated their self-esteem so much that they believed themselves superior to all other nations. They preserved themselves by keeping their distance from others. Blood mixing disturbed this little because what held them together was an ideal element, the shared possession of certain intellectual and emotional assets. The religion of Moses had this effect because it 1) allowed the people to partake in the grandeur of a new concept of God, 2) claimed that this people was chosen by this great God and destined for the proofs of his special favor, and 3) imposed on the people a progress in spirituality that, significant in itself, also opened the way to the appreciation of intellectual work and further drive renunciations.
This is our conclusion, and while we don't wish to retract any of it, we must admit that it feels somewhat unsatisfactory. The cause seems to not fully account for the effect; the phenomenon we aim to explain appears to be of a different magnitude than everything we've used to explain it. Could it be that all our previous investigations have uncovered only a superficial layer of the motivation, and that a deeper, more significant element is still waiting to be discovered? Given the extraordinary complexity of causation in life and history, one must be prepared for such a possibility.

Access to this deeper motivation might be found at a particular point in the preceding discussions. The religion of Moses did not exert its influence directly but in a strangely indirect manner. This does not mean it didn't have immediate effects or that it took centuries to fully manifest, as that much is understood when considering the development of a people's character. Instead, this qualification refers to a fact we've taken from Jewish religious history, or perhaps inserted into it.

We have stated that the Jewish people eventually rejected the religion of Moses—whether entirely or with some of its commandments retained, we cannot guess. With the assumption that during the long periods of conquering Canaan and struggling with its inhabitants, the religion of Yahweh did not substantially differ from the worship of other Baalim, we stand on historical ground despite later efforts to obscure this embarrassing reality.

However, the religion of Moses did not disappear without a trace; a kind of memory of it persisted, although obscured and distorted, perhaps supported by old records among individual members of the priestly caste. This tradition of a great past continued to exert influence from the background, gradually gaining more power over minds and eventually succeeding in transforming the god Yahweh into the god of Moses and reviving the long-abandoned religion of Moses.

In an earlier section of this treatise, we discussed the assumption that seems unavoidable if we are to understand such an achievement of tradition.

**The Return of the Repressed**
There are many similar phenomena that the analytical exploration of the mind has taught us. Some of these are considered pathological, while others are seen as part of the diversity of normality. However, this distinction matters little because the boundaries between them are not clearly defined. The mechanisms are largely the same. What is far more important is whether these changes occur within the self or manifest as external to it, where they are then called symptoms.

From the abundance of material, I first highlight cases related to character development. A young girl might strongly oppose her mother, cultivating all the traits she finds lacking in her mother and avoiding anything that reminds her of her. It is important to note that, like any female child, she had previously identified with her mother but now vehemently rejects this identification. However, if this girl marries and becomes a wife and mother herself, it should not surprise us to see her gradually become more like the mother she opposed, eventually restoring the previously overcome identification with her mother.

The same occurs with boys. Even the great Goethe, who likely despised his rigid and pedantic father during his genius years, developed traits in his old age that belonged to his father's character. The outcome can be even more striking when the contrast between the two people is sharper. A young man, who grew up with a worthless father, initially developed into a capable, reliable, and honorable person, in defiance of his father. However, at the peak of his life, his character changed, and he began to behave as if he had taken this very father as his role model.

To maintain the connection with our topic, it is crucial to remember that such processes always begin with an early childhood identification with the father. This identification is then rejected, overcompensated, and ultimately reasserts itself.
It is widely accepted that the experiences of the first five years have a decisive influence on life, one that cannot be countered by anything that happens later. There is much to say about how these early impressions persist against the influences of more mature life stages, but that discussion is not relevant here. What might be less known is that the most compelling influence comes from those impressions that impact the child at a time when we must consider their mental apparatus not yet fully receptive. The fact itself is indisputable, though it is so surprising that we may understand it better by comparing it to a photograph that can be developed and turned into an image after any length of delay.

It's worth noting that a creative artist, with the boldness allowed to them, anticipated this inconvenient discovery of ours. E.T.A. Hoffmann attributed the wealth of characters available to him for his writings to the changing scenes and impressions during a weeks-long journey in a stagecoach, which he experienced as an infant at his mother's breast. What children experience at the age of two and do not understand, they may never consciously remember, except in dreams. Only through psychoanalytical treatment can it become known to them, yet it bursts into their lives at a later time with compulsive impulses, directing their actions, imposing sympathies and antipathies, and often determining their choice of love, which can be so difficult to rationalize.

It is clear how these facts touch upon our problem in two main points. The first is the remoteness of time. Here, too, an artist may have the word. To explain his attachment, he invents: "You were my sister or my wife in past ages." (Goethe, vol. 4 of the Weimar edition, p. 97). This remoteness is recognized as the truly decisive moment, for example, in the unique state of memory we classify as "unconscious" for these childhood experiences. We expect to find an analogy here with the state we might attribute to tradition in the life of a people. Indeed, it has not been easy to incorporate the concept of the unconscious into mass psychology.
## Mechanisms Leading to Neuroses

Regular contributions to the phenomena we seek to understand reveal the mechanisms that lead to the formation of neuroses. These critical events occur in early childhood, yet the focus is not on the timing but on the process that responds to the event—the reaction to it. Schematically, one can say: As a result of the experience, a drive demand arises, seeking satisfaction. The self denies this satisfaction, either because the magnitude of the demand paralyzes it or because it perceives a threat in it. The first reason is more fundamental, but both amount to avoiding a danger situation. The self defends itself against the danger through the process of repression. The drive impulse is somehow inhibited, and the event, along with the associated perceptions and ideas, is forgotten. However, the process does not end there. The drive either retains its strength, regains it, or is reawakened by a new trigger. It renews its demand, and since the path to normal satisfaction is blocked by what we can call the "scar of repression," it finds another way to a so-called substitute satisfaction at a weak spot, which now emerges as a symptom—without the self's consent or understanding. All phenomena of symptom formation can rightly be described as the "return of the repressed." Their distinguishing feature is the significant distortion that the returning element undergoes compared to the original. 

Perhaps some may think that with this last group of facts, we have strayed too far from the resemblance to tradition. However, we should not regret this if it brings us closer to the problems of drive renunciation.

## Historical Truth

All these psychological excursions have been undertaken to make it more believable that the religion of Moses only took hold among the Jewish people as a tradition. We may have achieved no more than a certain level of probability. But let's assume we have fully proven our case; there would still remain the impression that we have only met the qualitative aspect of the requirement, not the quantitative one. Everything related to the emergence of a religion, certainly including Judaism, carries an element of grandeur that our explanations so far have not covered. There must be another element involved, for which there is little analogy and nothing similar—something unique and of the same magnitude as what it has become, like the religion itself.
Let's try approaching the subject from the opposite side. We understand that primitive people needed a god as a creator of the world, a tribal chief, and a personal caretaker. This god took the place of deceased fathers, about whom tradition still had something to say. People in later times, including our own, behave similarly. Even as adults, they remain childlike and in need of protection, believing that they cannot do without their god. This much is uncontested, but it's harder to understand why there must be only one god, why the progression from henotheism to monotheism gains such overwhelming importance. Certainly, as I have explained, the believer partakes in the greatness of their god, and the greater the god, the more reliable the protection they can provide. But the power of a god does not necessarily require their uniqueness. Many cultures saw the supremacy of their chief god in their dominion over other subordinate deities, without diminishing their greatness by acknowledging the existence of others. Additionally, making this god universal and concerned with all lands and peoples meant sacrificing a level of intimacy. It was like sharing their god with outsiders and compensating for this by claiming they were specially favored by this god. One could argue that the concept of a single god represents a progression in spirituality, but it is impossible to value this point too highly.

For this apparent gap in reasoning, devout believers have a satisfactory explanation. They say that the idea of a single god had such an overwhelming impact on people because it is a piece of eternal truth that, long concealed, finally emerged and then had to sweep everyone along with it. I must admit, such an element is indeed fitting for the magnitude of both the subject and its success.

I would like to accept this solution as well. However, I encounter a concern. The devout argument rests on an optimistic-idealistic assumption. It has not otherwise been established that the human intellect has a particularly fine sensitivity for truth or that the human soul shows a special inclination to recognize truth. On the contrary, I have found that our intellect often goes astray without warning and that nothing is more readily believed than what meets our wishful illusions, regardless of the truth. Therefore, I must add a caveat to my agreement. I also believe that the devout solution contains truth, but not material truth—rather, historical truth. I reserve the right to correct a certain distortion this truth has undergone upon its return. This means I do not believe in the existence of a single great god today, but rather that in ancient times there was a single person who must have seemed extraordinarily great then and who was later elevated to divinity in human memory.
We had assumed that the Moses religion was initially rejected and half-forgotten, only to resurface later as a tradition. Now, we believe that this process repeated itself a second time. When Moses brought the idea of a single God to the people, it wasn’t new; it was a revival of an experience from the dawn of the human family, an experience that had long faded from conscious memory. Yet, it was so significant and caused such profound changes in human life that it must have left some lasting traces in the human soul, comparable to a tradition.

Through psychoanalysis of individuals, we have learned that their earliest impressions, formed when the child could barely speak, sometimes manifest as compulsive effects without being consciously remembered. We feel justified in assuming the same about the earliest experiences of humanity as a whole. One such effect would be the emergence of the idea of a single great God, which should be recognized as a distorted but legitimate memory. This idea has a compulsive nature; it demands belief. To the extent that it is distorted, it can be called a delusion, but insofar as it represents the return of the past, it must be called truth. Even psychiatric delusions contain a fragment of truth, and the patient's conviction extends from this truth to the delusional overlay.

What follows is, until the end, a slightly modified repetition of the arguments presented in the first part.
In 1912, in my work "Totem and Taboo," I attempted to reconstruct the ancient situation that had such significant effects. I utilized theoretical ideas from Charles Darwin, Atkinson, and especially W. Robertson Smith, combining them with findings and insights from psychoanalysis. From Darwin, I borrowed the hypothesis that humans originally lived in small hordes, each one dominated by an older male who claimed all the females for himself and punished or eliminated the younger males, including his sons. Atkinson extended this depiction by suggesting that this patriarchal system ended in a rebellion by the sons, who united against their father, overpowered him, and consumed him together.

Following Robertson Smith's totem theory, I proposed that the father's horde was subsequently replaced by a totemistic brother clan. To live peacefully together, the victorious brothers relinquished their claim to the women for whose sake they had killed their father and adopted exogamy. The father's power was broken, and families were organized around matriarchy. The ambivalent feelings the sons had towards their father persisted throughout further development. Instead of the father, a specific animal was established as the totem; it was considered an ancestor and guardian spirit, not to be harmed or killed. However, once a year, the entire male community gathered for a feast, during which the usually revered totem animal was torn apart and consumed together. No one could be excluded from this meal; it was a ceremonial reenactment of the father’s killing, marking the beginning of social order, moral laws, and religion. Several authors before me have noted the similarity between Robertson Smith's totem meal and the Christian Eucharist.

I still adhere to this framework today. I have repeatedly faced harsh criticism for not changing my opinions in later editions of the book, even though newer ethnologists have unanimously rejected Robertson Smith's positions and proposed other, vastly different theories. My response is that I am well aware of these supposed advances. However, I am neither convinced of the correctness of these innovations nor of the errors attributed to Robertson Smith. A contradiction is not a refutation, and an innovation is not necessarily progress. Most importantly, I am not an ethnologist but a psychoanalyst. I had the right to select from ethnological literature what was useful for my analytical work. The works of the brilliant Robertson Smith have provided me with valuable connections to the psychological material of analysis and ways to utilize it. I have never engaged with his opponents.

### The Historical Development
I can't repeat the content of *Totem and Taboo* in detail here, but I need to address the long period between that hypothesized ancient time and the triumph of monotheism in historical eras. After the establishment of the brotherhood clan, matriarchy, exogamy, and totemism, a development began that can be described as the slow "return of the repressed." We use the term "the repressed" here in a figurative sense. It refers to something past, forgotten, and overcome in the life of a people, which we dare to equate with the repressed in the individual psyche. 

Initially, we don't know in what psychological form this past existed during its obscured period. It is challenging to transfer concepts from individual psychology to the psychology of groups, and I don't believe we gain anything by introducing the idea of a "collective" unconscious. The content of the unconscious is, after all, collective—common to all humans. So, for now, we rely on the use of analogies. The processes we study in the life of a people are very similar to those known from psychopathology, but they are not exactly the same.

We finally conclude that the psychological imprints of those ancient times have become hereditary, needing only to be awakened, not acquired, in each new generation. We think of the example of the undoubtedly "innate" symbolism that dates back to the development of language. All children are familiar with it without any instruction, and it is the same for all peoples despite the differences in languages.

What we may lack in certainty, we gain from other results of psychoanalytic research. We learn that our children react in a number of significant ways not according to their own experiences, but instinctively, comparable to animals, in ways that can only be explained by phylogenetic inheritance.
The return of what has been repressed happens gradually, certainly not spontaneously, but under the influence of all the changes in life conditions that fill human cultural history. I cannot provide a comprehensive overview of these dependencies or even a more than incomplete listing of the stages of this return. The father once again becomes the head of the family, though not nearly as unrestrained as the father of the primal horde. The totem animal gives way to the god through very clear transitions. Initially, the human-shaped god still carries the animal's head. Later, the god prefers to transform into this specific animal, then the animal becomes sacred to him and his favorite companion, or he has killed the animal and carries its name as a title. Between the totem animal and the god, the hero appears, often as a precursor to deification. The idea of a supreme deity seems to emerge early on, initially only shadowy, without involvement in the daily interests of humans. With the merging of tribes and peoples into larger units, the gods also organize into families and hierarchies. One among them is often elevated to the supreme ruler over gods and humans. The next step, worshiping only one god, happens hesitantly, and finally, the decision is made to grant all power to a single god and tolerate no other gods beside him. Only then was the glory of the primal horde father restored, and the emotions directed towards him could be repeated.

The first effect of encountering the long-missed and longed-for figure was overwhelming, much like the tradition of the legislation from Mount Sinai describes. Admiration, reverence, and gratitude for having found favor in his eyes—these are the only positive feelings the religion of Moses knows toward the father-god. The conviction of his irresistibility and the submission to his will couldn't have been more absolute for the helpless, intimidated son of the horde father. Indeed, this becomes fully understandable only when placed in the primitive and infantile milieu. Childlike emotional responses are far more intense and profoundly deep than those of adults; only religious ecstasy can bring this back. Thus, a fervor of devotion to God is the next reaction to the return of the great father.
The direction of this father-religion was set for all time, but its development was not complete. The essence of the father relationship includes ambivalence; over time, the hostility that once drove the sons to kill their admired and feared father had to emerge. Within the framework of the Moses religion, there was no room for the direct expression of murderous father-hatred; only a powerful reaction to it could surface—the sense of guilt for this hostility, the bad conscience that one had sinned against God and continued to sin. This guilt, constantly kept alive by the prophets and soon becoming an integral part of the religious system, had another superficial motivation that cleverly masked its true origin. The people were suffering, their hopes for God's favor were not being realized, and it was difficult to hold onto the cherished illusion of being God's chosen people. If one did not want to give up this happiness, the feeling of guilt over one’s own sinfulness provided a convenient way to absolve God. They deserved nothing better than to be punished by Him for not keeping His commandments. To satisfy this insatiable guilt, which came from a much deeper source, the commandments had to become increasingly strict, meticulous, and even petty. In a new frenzy of moral asceticism, they imposed ever more renunciations on themselves and achieved, at least in doctrine and prescription, ethical heights that other ancient peoples did not reach. Many Jews see in this higher development the second main characteristic and significant achievement of their religion. Our discussions should show how it connects with the first—the idea of the one God. However, this ethics cannot deny its origin from the guilt over suppressed hostility toward God. It has the unfinished and unfinishable nature of obsessive-compulsive reaction formations; one can also infer that it serves the hidden purposes of self-punishment.
The further development goes beyond Judaism. The rest of what reoccurred from the primal father tragedy was no longer compatible with the religion of Moses. The guilt of that time was no longer confined to the Jewish people. It had permeated all Mediterranean peoples as a vague unease, a foreboding of doom without a known cause. Contemporary historians speak of the aging of ancient culture; I suspect they have only identified incidental causes and aids to this widespread discontent. The clarification of the oppressive situation originated from Judaism. Despite all the approximations and preparations around, it was a Jewish man, Saul of Tarsus, who as a Roman citizen called himself Paul, in whose mind the realization first broke through: "We are so unhappy because we killed God the Father." 

It's entirely understandable that he could only grasp this piece of truth in the delusional guise of the joyful message: "We are redeemed from all guilt since one of us sacrificed his life to atone for us." In this formulation, the killing of God was not mentioned, but a crime that required atonement through a sacrificial death could only have been murder. The connection between the delusion and historical truth was established by the assurance that the sacrifice was God's Son. With the strength that flowed to him from the source of historical truth, this new faith overcame all obstacles; the blissful chosenness was replaced by liberating redemption. However, the fact of the father-killing had to overcome greater resistance upon its return to human memory than the other content that constituted monotheism; it had to endure a stronger distortion. The unspeakable crime was replaced by the assumption of a shadowy original sin.

Original sin and redemption through sacrificial death became the cornerstones of the new religion founded by Paul. Whether there was indeed a leader and instigator of the murder in the brotherhood that rebelled against the primal father, or whether this figure was later created by the imagination of artists to heroize themselves and inserted into tradition, must remain undecided. After Christian doctrine broke out of the confines of Judaism, it absorbed elements from many other sources, abandoned some features of pure monotheism, and adapted in many details to the rituals of other Mediterranean peoples. It was as if Egypt was now taking revenge on the heirs of Akhenaten. 

Noteworthy is how the new religion dealt with the old ambivalence in the father relationship. Its main content was reconciliation with God the Father, atonement for the crime committed against him, but the other side of the emotional relationship showed in that the Son, who took on the atonement, became God himself alongside the Father and essentially in place of the Father. Originating from a father religion, Christianity became a son religion. It did not escape the fate of having to remove the father.
Only a part of the Jewish people embraced the new teaching. Those who refused are still called Jews today. This division has separated them even more sharply from others than before. They had to endure accusations from the new religious community, which included Egyptians, Greeks, Syrians, Romans, and eventually even Germans, that they had killed God. In its full form, this accusation would be: "They refuse to acknowledge that they killed God, while we admit it and have been cleansed of this guilt." It's easy to see how much truth lies behind this accusation. The reason Jews couldn't make the progress implied by acknowledging the murder of God, despite its distortions, would be the subject of a separate investigation. In a way, they have taken on a tragic guilt, and they have been made to pay dearly for it.

Our investigation may have shed some light on how the Jewish people acquired the traits that characterize them. However, it provided less clarity on how they have maintained their individuality to this day. But it's unreasonable to demand or expect exhaustive answers to such mysteries. All I can offer is a contribution that must be judged according to the limitations mentioned at the outset.
