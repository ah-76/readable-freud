Comedy (1927)
Freud explores the liberating effects of comedy, suggesting that the above-self serves to protect the self from suffering, while asserting the triumph of the pleasure principle over reality.

In my book <em>Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious</em> (1905), I actually only approached comedy from an economic standpoint. I was concerned with finding the source of pleasure in comedy, and I believe I've shown that the pleasurable gain in comedy comes from saved emotional expenditure.

The process of comedy occurs in two ways: either within a single person who adopts the comic attitude themselves, while the second person assumes the role of the audience and beneficiary - or between two people, one of whom has no involvement in the comic process, while the second makes the uninvolved person the object of their comic observation. To dwell on the coarsest example, when the convicted criminal who is being led to the gallows on Monday remarks

<blockquote>"Well <em>this</em> week's off to a good start"</blockquote>

then he himself develops the comedy, the comic process is completed in his person, and it clearly brings him a certain satisfaction. As an uninvolved listener, I'm struck by a sort of indirect effect of the criminal's comic achievement; I feel, perhaps similarly to him, the 'pleasurable gain' in comedy.

The second case occurs, for example, when a poet or storyteller describes the behavior of real or fictional characters in a comic way. These characters themselves do not need to display any comedy; the comic attitude is solely the concern of the one who makes them the object, and the reader or listener, just like in the previous case, shares in the enjoyment of the comedy. In summary, one can say that the comic attitude — whatever it may consist of — can be directed toward oneself or others; it is assumed that it brings a gain in pleasure to the one who does it, and a similar gain in pleasure accrues to the uninvolved listener.

We best grasp the genesis of the comic pleasure-gain when we focus on the audience in front of whom someone else develops comedy. They see this other person in a situation that suggests they will show signs of emotion: they will be angry, complain, express pain, be frightened, disgusted, or perhaps even despair. The audience is ready to follow them in this, to let the same emotional reactions arise in themselves. But this emotional readiness is disappointed; the other person does not express any emotion but instead makes a joke. The saved emotional expenditure now becomes the comic pleasure for the audience.

So far so good. But one soon realizes that it's the process within the <em>comedian</em> that deserves the most attention. There's no doubt that the essence of comedy consists in saving oneself from the emotions to which the situation would give rise, and surpassing the possibility of such emotional expressions with a joke. In this sense, the process within the comedian must align with that of the audience—or more precisely, the audience's process must copy that of the comedian. But how does the comedian achieve the mental attitude that makes emotional release unnecessary? What happens dynamically within "the comic attitude"? Clearly, the solution to the problem must be sought in the comedian, while the audience only experiences an echo, a copy, of this unknown process.

Let's get familiar with some characteristics. Comedy has not only something liberating, like quips and gags, but also something grand and elevating, traits not found in the other two forms of pleasure derived from intellectual activity. The grandeur clearly lies in the triumph of narcissism, in the victorious assertion of the self's invulnerability. The self refuses to let the provocations of reality offend it or compel it to suffer; it insists that the traumas of the external world cannot touch it, and indeed, they only provide opportunities for pleasure. This last feature is absolutely essential to comedy. Suppose the criminal being led to execution on Monday had said, "I don't care, what does it matter if a guy like me gets hanged? The world won't fall apart because of it." We would have to judge that while this speech contains that magnificent superiority over the real situation, it is wise and justified, but it does not reveal a trace of comedy. In fact, it rests on an assessment of reality that directly contradicts comedy. <strong>Comedy is not resigned - it is defiant.</strong> It signifies not only triumph of self, but of the pleasure principle, which here manages to assert itself against the unfavorable conditions of reality.

<hr>

Through these two last traits — the rejection of the demands of reality and the assertion of the pleasure principle — comedy approaches the regressive or reactionary processes that occupy us so extensively in psychopathology. With its defense against the possibility of suffering, it takes its place in the great series of methods to escape the compulsion of suffering developed by the human mind: a series that starts with neurosis, culminates in madness, and includes intoxication, self-absorption, and ecstasy. Comedy owes to this connection a dignity that, for example, quips and gags completely lack, for quipping serves <em>only</em> the gain of pleasure, or places the gain of pleasure at the service of aggression. So what is the comic attitude through which one refuses to suffer, emphasizes the invincibility of the self against the real world, and asserts the pleasure principle victoriously—all without giving up the ground of mental health like other methods with similar intentions? These two achievements seem incompatible with each other.

If we consider the situation where someone adopts a comic attitude toward others, the interpretation I have already tentatively hinted at in my Joke Book seems obvious: that the comedian behaves toward them like an adult toward a child, recognizing and smiling at the insignificance of the interests and sufferings that seem great to the child. Thus, the comedian gains his superiority by assuming the role of the adult, in a way identifying with the father, and reducing others to the level of children. This assumption probably captures the facts, but it hardly seems compelling. One might ask: How does the comedian presume to take on this role?

<hr>

But one recalls the other, probably more original and significant, situation of comedy: that someone directs the comic attitude against their own person in order to fend off their own possibilities of suffering. Does it make sense to say that someone treats themselves like a child and simultaneously plays the role of the superior adult against this child?

I believe we give strong support to this somewhat implausible notion if we consider what we have learned from pathological experiences about the structure of our self. This self is not a simple entity but contains a special agency at its core—the above-self. Sometimes, the self merges with it so that we cannot distinguish the two, while in other circumstances, the self separates sharply from it. The above-self is genetically the heir to the parental agency and often keeps the self under strict dependence, treating it much as the parents—or the father—once treated the child in early years. We gain a dynamic explanation of the comic attitude if we assume that it consists of the comedian shifting the psychological emphasis from their self to their above-self. With this now inflated above-self, the self can seem tiny, all its interests trivial, and the above-self may easily suppress the self's potential reactions due to this new distribution of energy.

<hr>

Remaining true to my usual way of expression, instead of saying a shift of psychological emphasis, I will refer to the displacement of large amounts of energy. The question then arises: can we imagine such extensive displacements from one agency of the mental apparatus to another? It seems like a new assumption, made ad hoc, but remember that I've repeatedly—though not often enough—in my attempts at a metapsychological understanding of mental events considered such a factor. For instance, I assumed that the difference between an ordinary erotic object-involvement and the state of being in love lies in the latter involving much more energy being transferred to the object; the self almost emptying itself into the object. While studying some cases of paranoia, I found that delusions of persecution are formed early and persist for a long time without noticeable effect until, due to a specific trigger, they receive the amount of energy that makes them dominant. The cure of such paranoid attacks is likely less about dissolving and correcting the delusions and more about depriving them of the energy bestowed upon them.

The alternation of depression and euphoria, of the cruel suppression of the self by the above-self and of the liberation of the self after such pressure, gave us the impression of such a shift in energy that could also be used to explain a whole series of phenomena in normal mental life. If this has been done to such a limited extent so far, the reason lies in our rather commendable restraint. The field in which I feel secure is the pathology of mental life; here, I make my observations and acquire my convictions. For the time being, I venture a judgment about the normal only to the extent that I infer the normal from the isolations and distortions of pathological phenomena. Once this hesitation is overcome, I will recognize the significant role that static conditions and the dynamic changes in the quantity of energy investment play in understanding mental processes.

<hr>

I believe, therefore, that the possibility suggested here — that a person in a particular situation suddenly over-invests their above-self and then modifies the reactions of their self from this vantage point — deserves to be taken seriously. What I suspect regarding comedy, also occurs analogously in the connected moment of 'the joke'. In my Joke Book, I had to assume that in the creation of a joke, a preconscious thought is left for a moment to unconscious processing, meaning that the joke is the contribution the unconscious makes to comedy in general. Similarly, 'the comic' becomes the contribution to comedy in general through the mediation of the above-self.

We otherwise know the above-self as a strict master. One might say it doesn't quite align with this character for it to condescend to allow the self a small gain in pleasure. It is true that the pleasure of 'the comic' never reaches the intensity of the pleasure in gags or jokes, never expresses itself in raucous laughter. It's also true that when the above-self induces the comic attitude, it actually dismisses reality and serves an illusion. However, we attribute a high-quality character to this rather faint pleasure, without quite knowing why—we perceive it as particularly liberating and elevating. The joke that 'the comic' makes is not the essential thing; a joke is merely a <em>sample</em> of comedy. The main point is the intention that comedy carries out, whether it is directed at oneself or others: 

<blockquote>"Look, this is the world that seems so dangerous. It's child's play - perfect for making a joke about!"</blockquote>

<hr>

If it is indeed the above-self that speaks so lovingly and comfortingly to the intimidated self through comedy, then we should remember that we've still much to learn about the nature of the above-self. 

Incidentally, not all people are capable of adopting a comic attitude. It is a precious and rare gift, and many lack even the ability to enjoy the comic pleasure conveyed to them. 

Finally, if the above-self, through comedy, seeks to comfort the self and protect it from suffering, it has not contradicted its descent from the parental agency.
