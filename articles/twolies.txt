Two Lies Told by Children (1913)
Freud explores the psychological motives behind lies told by otherwise honest children, emphasizing how intense 'love motives' can lead to detrimental misunderstandings between children and those they value greatly.

It's understandable that children lie when imitating the lies of adults. However, several lies told by well-behaved children carry a special significance and should prompt educators to reflect rather than become embittered. Such lies occur under the influence of intense love motives and become fateful when they lead to misunderstandings between the child and the person they love.

<strong>FIRST</strong>

A seven-year-old girl (in her second school year) asked her father for money to buy paint for coloring Easter eggs. He refused, claiming he had no money. Shortly thereafter, she asked him for money to contribute to a wreath for the recently deceased regional princess. Each schoolchild was expected to bring fifty pfennigs. The father gave her ten marks; she paid her contribution, placed nine marks on his desk, and used the remaining fifty pfennigs to buy paint, which she hid in her play cabinet.

At the dinner table, the father suspiciously asked her what she had done with the missing fifty pfennigs and whether she had bought paint with it. She denied it, but her brother, who was two years older and with whom she intended to color the eggs, betrayed her. The paints were found in the cabinet. The enraged father left the miscreant to her mother for punishment, which was very severe. The mother herself was later shaken when she realized how deeply despairing the child had become. She caressed her after the punishment and took her for a walk to comfort her. However, the effects of this incident, which the patient herself described as a "turning point" in her youth, proved irreversible.

Until then, she had been a wild, confident child, but from that point on, she became shy and timid. During her engagement, she fell into a rage she couldn't understand when her mother began purchasing furniture and trousseau items for her. She felt that since it was her money, no one else should be allowed to buy anything with it. As a young woman, she was reluctant to ask her husband for money for her personal needs and unnecessarily separated "her" money from his.

During her treatment, it happened a few times that her husband's money transfers were delayed, leaving her penniless in the unfamiliar city. After she told me this once, I tried to get her to promise to borrow a small sum from me if the situation repeated itself. She made this promise but did not keep it when the next financial difficulty arose and preferred to pawn her jewelry. She explained that she couldn't take money from me.

The appropriation of the fifty pfennigs in childhood carried a meaning the father could not have suspected. Some time before starting school, she had exhibited a curious behavior involving money. A friendly neighbor had given her a small sum as she accompanied the neighbor's younger son to a shop to buy something. As the elder, she brought back the remaining money after the purchase. However, when she encountered the neighbor's maid on the street, she threw the money onto the pavement.

In analyzing this action, which she couldn't explain herself, she thought of Judas throwing away the silver pieces he had received for betraying the Lord. She was sure she had been familiar with the Passion story even before starting school. But how did she dare identify herself with Judas?

At three and a half, she had a nanny to whom she became very attached. This nanny entered into a romantic relationship with a doctor, whose practice she visited with the child. It seems the child witnessed various sexual incidents. Whether she saw the doctor give the nanny money is uncertain; however, it's indisputable that the nanny gave the child small coins to ensure her silence, which were used to buy sweets on the way home. It's also possible the doctor himself occasionally gave the child money.

Nevertheless, the child betrayed her nanny to her mother out of jealousy. She played so conspicuously with the coins she had brought home that the mother had to ask: "Where did you get the money?" The nanny was dismissed.

Receiving money from someone early on took on the significance of physical intimacy, of a love relationship, for her. Taking money from her father was equivalent to a declaration of love. The fantasy of her father being her partner was so alluring that, with its help, her childish desire for Easter egg dyes easily prevailed over the prohibition. However, she couldn't admit to taking the money; she had to deny it because the motive behind the act, unconscious to her, was inadmissible. Her father's punishment, therefore, was a rejection of the affection she offered, a spurning, and thus, it broke her spirit. During therapy, a severe state of dejection arose, the resolution of which led to the memory I've shared here, triggered when I was once compelled to replicate the rejection by asking her to stop bringing flowers.

For the psychoanalyst, it hardly needs emphasizing that the child's small experience exemplifies one of those exceedingly frequent cases where earlier anal eroticism continues into later love life. The pleasure in coloring eggs also stems from the same source.

<strong>SECOND</strong>

A woman currently severely ill due to a life disappointment had once been a particularly capable, truth-loving, serious, and kind girl before becoming a tender wife. Earlier still, in her first years of life, she had been a stubborn and discontented child. Although she quickly transformed into someone overly good and overly conscientious, events took place during her school years that would later cause her great self-reproach during her illness, which she saw as proof of her deep depravity. Her memory told her that she had often boasted and lied back then. Once, on the way to school, a classmate boasted, “Yesterday we had ice cream for lunch.” She replied, “Oh, we have ice cream every day.” In reality, she didn't understand what ice cream for lunch meant. She only knew ice in the long blocks in which it was delivered by wagon but assumed it must have been something fancy. So, she didn't want to fall behind her classmate.

When she was 10 years old, the class was once tasked with drawing a circle freehand during art lesson. However, she used a compass instead, easily producing a perfect circle, and triumphantly showed her work to her neighbor. The teacher overheard her bragging, noticed the compass marks on the circle, and confronted the girl. She stubbornly denied everything, refused to be convinced by any evidence, and dealt with the situation by falling into a defiant silence. The teacher discussed the matter with her father; both decided, given the girl's otherwise good behavior, not to pursue the offense further.

Both lies of the child were motivated by the same complex. As the oldest of five siblings, the girl developed an unusually intense attachment to her father early on, which would later be the downfall of her happiness in life. However, she soon discovered that her beloved father did not possess the greatness she was ready to attribute to him. He had financial difficulties to contend with, and he wasn't as powerful or distinguished as she had imagined. She couldn't accept this diminution of her ideal. Like a woman who channels all her ambition into the man she loves, she became fiercely motivated to protect her father from the world. So, she boasted to her classmates to avoid diminishing her father's stature.

Later, when she learned to translate "Eis" to "glace" in the context of lunch, the path was paved for her guilt (over this memory) to <em>transform</em> into a fear of glass shards and splinters.

The father was an excellent draftsman, and his talent often elicited delight and admiration from the children. In identifying with her father, she drew that circle at school, which she could only complete using fraudulent means. It was as though she wanted to boast, "Look at what my father can do!" The guilt associated with her intense affection for her father found its expression in this attempted deceit; a confession was impossible for the same reason as in the previous observation—it would have meant confessing her hidden incestuous love.

One should not think lightly of such episodes in a child's life. It would be a grave mistake to predict the development of an immoral character based on such childhood misdeeds. However, they are connected to the strongest motives of the child's psyche and signal predispositions to future fates or neuroses.
