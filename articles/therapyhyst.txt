The Psychotherapy of Hysteria (1895)
Freud wrote this 17,000 word publication himself, as part of "Studies on Hysteria" (co-written with Josef Breuer).

In this book's "Preliminary Communication," we reported that while researching the etiology of hysterical symptoms, we also developed a therapeutic method that I consider practically significant. "We found, initially to our great surprise, that individual hysterical symptoms disappeared immediately and without recurrence if we succeeded in bringing the memory of the triggering event into full clarity, thereby also evoking the accompanying affect, and if the patient then described the event in as detailed a manner as possible and gave words to the affect" (p. 85).

We further sought to understand how my psychotherapeutic method works: "It nullifies the effect of the originally unexpressed idea by allowing the pent-up affect associated with it to be discharged through speech, and brings about associative correction by drawing it into normal consciousness (in light hypnosis) or by negating it through medical suggestion, as happens in somnambulism with amnesia" (p. 97).

I will now attempt to explain in detail how far this method can be applied, what it accomplishes more than other methods, the techniques and difficulties it involves, even though the essential aspects of this have already been included in the preceding case histories, and I cannot avoid repeating myself in this presentation.

<strong>PART 1</strong>

I can personally affirm that I still hold to the content of the "Preliminary Communication." However, I must admit that over the years since then—during which I have continuously engaged with the problems addressed there—new perspectives have emerged that have led to at least a partially different grouping and understanding of the material and facts previously known. It would be unfair to burden my esteemed friend Dr Joseph Breuer with too much responsibility for this development. Therefore, I present the following remarks primarily in my own name.

When I attempted to use Breuer's method of curing hysterical symptoms through investigation and abreaction in hypnosis on a larger series of patients, I encountered two difficulties that led me to modify both the technique and my understanding. (1) Not all individuals who unmistakably exhibited hysterical symptoms and likely shared the same psychological mechanism were hypnotizable; (2) I had to address the question of what fundamentally characterizes hysteria and how it distinguishes itself from other neuroses.

<hr>

I will delay discussing how I managed the first difficulty and what I learned from it until later. For now, I will focus on how I addressed the second problem in daily practice. It's very difficult to fully understand a case of neurosis before subjecting it to a thorough analysis, an analysis that results only from the application of Breuer's method. However, the decision about diagnosis and type of therapy must be made before such thorough knowledge is obtained. I had no choice but to select cases for the cathartic method that could provisionally be diagnosed as hysteria, showing one or more of the stigmata or characteristic symptoms of hysteria. Sometimes, despite the hysteria diagnosis, the therapeutic results were quite poor, and even the analysis revealed nothing significant. Other times, I attempted to treat neuroses with Breuer's method that certainly would not have been considered hysteria by anyone, and I found that they could be influenced and even resolved in this way. For example, this happened with compulsive ideas, genuine compulsive ideas according to Westphal's pattern, in cases that did not resemble hysteria in any way. Therefore, the psychological mechanism revealed by the "Preliminary Communication" could not be pathognomonic for hysteria; I also could not bring myself to lump so many other neuroses together with hysteria for the sake of this mechanism. Finally, the plan to treat all other relevant neuroses similarly to hysteria, to investigate their etiology and the nature of their psychological mechanism, and to base the decision on the validity of the hysteria diagnosis on the outcome of this investigation pulled me out of all the doubts that had been stirred up.

<hr>

Starting from Breuer's method, I began to delve into the etiology and mechanism of neuroses in general. I was fortunate to arrive at useful results in a relatively short time. Initially, it became evident to me that, insofar as one can speak of causation for the development of neuroses, the etiology should be sought in sexual factors. This led to the finding that various sexual factors, in a broad sense, also produce different patterns of neurotic disorders. As this relationship became more confirmed, it became possible to use etiology to characterize neuroses and to establish a clear distinction between different neurotic disease patterns. If etiological characteristics consistently matched clinical ones, this approach was justified.

This method revealed to me that neurasthenia corresponds to a monotonous clinical picture in which, as analyses showed, a "psychological mechanism" plays no role. Neurasthenia is sharply distinct from obsessive-compulsive neurosis, the neurosis of genuine obsessive ideas, for which a complex psychological mechanism, an etiology similar to that of hysteria, and a significant potential for resolution through psychotherapy can be recognized. On the other hand, it seemed reasonable to separate from neurasthenia a neurotic symptom complex that depends on a fundamentally different, even opposite, etiology, while the component symptoms of this complex are held together by a characteristic recognized by E. Hecker in 1893. These symptoms are either manifestations, equivalents, or remnants of anxiety expressions, and I have therefore named this complex, which should be separated from neurasthenia, anxiety neurosis. I have claimed that it arises from the accumulation of physical tension, which is itself of sexual origin; this neurosis does not involve a psychological mechanism but regularly influences the mental life, so that "anxious expectation," phobias, hyperesthesia to pain, and other symptoms are its regular manifestations. This anxiety neurosis, as I understand it, certainly overlaps with the neurosis known as "hypochondria" in many descriptions, alongside hysteria and neurasthenia; however, I do not consider the delineation of this neurosis in any of the existing works to be correct, and I find the usefulness of the term hypochondria compromised by its fixed association with the symptom of "fear of illness."

<hr>

Having established the distinct pictures of neurasthenia, anxiety neurosis, and obsessive-compulsive disorder, I turned my attention to the commonly occurring cases of neuroses that are considered under the diagnosis of hysteria. I realized that it is inappropriate to label an entire neurosis as hysterical just because some of its symptoms display hysterical signs. This practice could be explained by the fact that hysteria is the oldest, best-known, and most striking of the relevant neuroses; however, it was an abuse, the same one that had attributed so many traits of perversion and degeneration to hysteria. Whenever a hysterical sign, an anesthesia, or a characteristic attack was discovered in a complicated case of psychological degeneration, the whole case was labeled "hysteria," leading to the most severe and contradictory elements being united under this label. Just as this diagnosis was certainly incorrect, it was also necessary to distinguish between neurotic conditions, and since neurasthenia, anxiety neurosis, and the like were known in their pure forms, they should not be overlooked in combination.

Thus, the following understanding seemed more justified: The commonly occurring neuroses should mostly be called "mixed" neuroses. Pure forms of neurasthenia and anxiety neurosis can be easily found, especially in young people. Pure cases of hysteria and obsessive-compulsive disorder are rare; these two neuroses are usually combined with an anxiety neurosis. This frequent occurrence of mixed neuroses is due to the common blending of their etiological factors, sometimes by coincidence, sometimes due to causal relationships between the events from which the etiological factors of the neuroses arise. This can be easily demonstrated in individual cases. For hysteria, this implies that it is hardly possible to consider it separately from the context of sexual neuroses. Typically, hysteria represents only one side, one aspect of the complex neurotic case and can be found and treated as an isolated neurosis only in borderline cases. In a series of cases, one might say: "a potiori fit denominatio" (the name is derived from the most significant part).

<hr>

I want to examine the case histories shared here to see if they support my view of the clinical interdependence of hysteria. Anna O., Breuer's patient, seems to contradict this and presents a case of purely hysterical illness. However, this case, so fruitful for understanding hysteria, was not initially viewed by its observer from the perspective of sexual neurosis and cannot be used for that purpose today. When I began analyzing the second patient, Mrs. Emmy v. N., I did not anticipate a sexual neurosis as the basis for her hysteria. I had recently returned from Charcot's school and considered the connection between hysteria and sexuality as a type of disgrace—much like the patients themselves do. Reviewing my notes on this case today, it is clear to me that I must acknowledge a severe anxiety neurosis with anxious anticipation and phobias stemming from sexual abstinence, combined with hysteria.

Case 3, Miss Lucy R., might be best described as a borderline case of pure hysteria. It is a short, episodic hysteria with unmistakably sexual causes, resembling an anxiety neurosis; an overly mature, love-needing girl whose affections are prematurely awakened by a misunderstanding. However, I did not detect an anxiety neurosis, or it escaped my notice. Case 4, Katharina, is a perfect example of what I call virginal anxiety; a combination of anxiety neurosis and hysteria. The former produces the symptoms, the latter repeats and works with them. It is also a typical case of many youthful neuroses labeled "hysteria." Case 5, Miss Elisabeth v. R., has not been explored as a sexual neurosis; I could only suggest—and not confirm—a suspicion that spinal neurasthenia might have been its basis. I must add that pure hysteria has become even rarer in my experience since then. 

If I grouped these four cases as hysteria and ignored the key aspects of sexual neuroses in discussing them, it is because they are older cases where I had not yet conducted targeted research into their neurotic sexual foundations. If I have not shared twelve cases, which would provide confirmation of the psychological mechanism of hysterical phenomena I claim, it is only because the analysis revealed these cases to be sexual neuroses, even though no diagnostician would dispute their "hysteria" label. The explanation of such sexual neuroses, however, exceeds the scope of this joint publication.

I don’t want to be misunderstood as implying that I don't consider hysteria a distinct neurotic condition, or that I see it merely as a psychological expression of anxiety neurosis, attributing only "ideogenic" symptoms to it and transferring the somatic symptoms (hysterogenic points, anesthesias) to anxiety neurosis. None of that is true. I believe that one can treat hysteria independently, in every respect except for therapy. When it comes to therapy, practical goals are paramount—namely, the elimination of the overall suffering condition. And since hysteria often appears as part of a mixed neurosis, it is akin to mixed infections, where the goal of preserving life doesn't align solely with combating the effects of a single pathogen.

It is crucial for me to differentiate the role of hysteria in mixed neurotic conditions from that of neurasthenia, anxiety neurosis, and so forth because this separation allows me to succinctly describe the therapeutic value of the cathartic method. I would venture to assert that, in principle, this method is fully capable of eliminating any hysterical symptom. However, as is easily apparent, it is completely powerless against the phenomena of neurasthenia and only seldom, and in roundabout ways, impacts the psychological consequences of anxiety neurosis. Its therapeutic efficacy in individual cases will therefore depend on whether the hysterical component of the condition is significantly substantial compared to other neurotic components.

Another limitation of the cathartic method, which I’ve already pointed out in the 'Preliminary Communication,' is that it does not influence the causal conditions of hysteria and therefore cannot prevent new symptoms from arising once the existing ones are eliminated. On the whole, I must assert that our therapeutic method holds a prominent place within the framework of neurotic therapy. However, I would caution against evaluating or applying it outside this context. Since I cannot provide a comprehensive "neurosis therapy" as would be required by a practicing physician at this point, the preceding statements should be taken as a deferral to possible future communications. Yet, I believe I can further elaborate and clarify with the following remarks:

1. I do not claim that I have successfully eliminated all hysterical symptoms that I attempted to treat using the cathartic method. However, I believe the obstacles were due to personal circumstances of the cases and not fundamental issues. I can disregard these unsuccessful cases when making a judgment, much like a surgeon might set aside cases of death due to anesthesia, post-operative bleeding, or accidental infection when assessing a new technique. When I later discuss the difficulties and drawbacks of the method, these types of failures will be re-evaluated.

**The Cathartic Method's Value and Application in Treating Hysteria**

The cathartic method isn't worthless simply because it addresses symptoms rather than underlying causes. In reality, a causal therapy is often just preventative—it stops further damage from occurring but doesn't necessarily eliminate the damage that has already been done. Usually, a second action is needed to address those existing issues, and in the case of hysteria, the cathartic method is incredibly effective for this purpose.

When a period of hysterical activity or an acute hysterical attack is over and only hysterical symptoms remain, the cathartic method is perfectly suitable and achieves full and lasting results. Such a favorable situation for therapy often arises in matters of sexual life, due to the significant fluctuations in sexual desire intensity and the complexity of conditions needed for sexual trauma. In these cases, the cathartic method can accomplish all that is required. The therapist can't aim to change a hysterical constitution; they must be content if they can eliminate the suffering that such a constitution tends to produce when aided by external conditions. Satisfaction comes when the patient becomes functional again. Moreover, the therapist can take comfort in the future, even considering the possibility of relapses. They understand that the primary characteristic in the etiology of neuroses is that their creation is often overdetermined—that multiple factors must come together for the condition to manifest. Therefore, they can hope that this convergence won't happen again soon, even if some of the etiological factors remain active.

One might argue that in these resolved cases of hysteria, the remaining symptoms would eventually disappear on their own. However, it's worth noting that this spontaneous recovery is often neither rapid nor complete, and can be significantly accelerated by therapeutic intervention. Whether the cathartic therapy heals only what could spontaneously recover or occasionally cures things that wouldn't have resolved on their own, can remain an open question for now.
### Acute Hysteria and the Cathartic Method

When encountering an acute hysteria case, marked by the active production of hysterical symptoms and the consequent overwhelming of the self (hysterical psychosis), the cathartic method is unlikely to significantly alter the impression or course of the illness. In such a situation, the position against the neurosis is akin to that of a psychoanalytic therapist against an acute infectious disease. The causes of the hysteria have exerted their influence sufficiently in the past, beyond the reach of current intervention. These causes manifest themselves after overcoming the incubation period. The condition cannot be halted; one must wait for it to run its course while creating the most favorable conditions for the patient. 

Removing the symptoms during such an acute period is futile, as the eliminated symptoms will soon be replaced by new ones. The therapist is forced to endure the discouraging impression of a never-ending task, similar to Sisyphus pushing his boulder, with a monumental effort yielding little satisfaction. This exhaustive effort, alongside the dissatisfaction of the patient’s family—who may not understand the necessary duration of acute neuroses compared to analogous acute infectious diseases—will likely render the consistent application of the cathartic method impractical in such cases. However, it is worth considering whether the repeated removal of symptoms during acute hysteria might have a healing effect by supporting the patient's normal self in its defensive efforts, possibly preventing them from descending into psychosis or a state of final confusion.

What the cathartic method can achieve even in acute hysteria, and how it can limit the production of new symptoms in a noticeable way, is explicitly illustrated by the history of Anna O., where Josef Breuer first practiced this psychotherapeutic procedure.
**(5) Dealing with Chronic Hysteria and Symptomatic Therapy**

When it comes to chronic hysteria, which presents a constant but moderate production of hysteric symptoms, one truly learns to regret the lack of causally effective therapy. Yet, one also comes to appreciate the importance of the cathartic method as symptomatic therapy. This situation involves dealing with damage from a persistently active cause. It's crucial to strengthen the patient's nervous system's resistance. One must acknowledge that the existence of a hysteric symptom weakens this resistance and represents a factor predisposing the individual to hysteria. 

As seen from the mechanism of monosymptomatic hysteria, a new hysteric symptom most easily forms in connection and by analogy to an already existing one. The point where a symptom has previously manifested becomes a weak spot where another symptom is likely to emerge. An already split-off psychological group acts like a provoking crystal, from which further crystallization can effortlessly proceed. Eliminating existing symptoms and reversing the psychological changes underlying them restores the patient's full resistance capacity, enabling them to resist harmful influences effectively. Providing such patients with extended supervision and periodic "chimney sweeping" can be highly beneficial.

**(6) Addressing Apparent Contradictions with Hysteric Symptoms**

I must also address the apparent contradiction between acknowledging that not all hysteric symptoms are psychogenic and claiming that all of them can be resolved through psychotherapeutic methods. The solution lies in understanding that some of these non-psychogenic symptoms, while indicative of illness, shouldn't be classified as suffering, such as the stigmata. Practically, it doesn’t matter if they persist even after the therapeutic resolution of the illness. For other such symptoms, it seems that they may be indirectly affected and resolved by psychogenic symptoms, just as they might indirectly depend on psychological causes.

I must now mention the challenges and downsides of our therapeutic process, especially those that may not be immediately obvious from the previous case histories or the following remarks on the technique. I aim to list and hint rather than elaborate in detail: The process is laborious and time-consuming for the therapist. It requires a great interest in psychological phenomena and, indeed, personal empathy for the patient. I cannot imagine being able to delve into the psychological mechanisms of hysteria in a person who seems crude and repulsive to me, who fails to evoke any human sympathy upon closer acquaintance. In contrast, I can treat a patient with a physical ailment such as tuberculosis or rheumatism without such personal liking.

Similar conditions are required from the patients. Below a certain level of intelligence, the process is not applicable at all, and any presence of mental deficiency significantly complicates it. The full consent and undivided attention of the patient is necessary, but above all, their trust, as the analysis regularly delves into the most intimate and hidden psychological processes. A significant portion of patients who might benefit from such treatment withdraw as soon as they get an inkling of the direction of the investigation. For these individuals, the therapist remains a stranger.

Other patients, who decide to entrust themselves to the therapist and grant a level of trust typically given voluntarily but never demanded, often find that their personal relationship with the therapist takes center stage, at least temporarily. In fact, it seems that such an influence of the therapist is a condition under which solving the problem is even possible. Whether or not hypnosis is employed doesn’t fundamentally change this dynamic. However, it is fair to emphasize that these drawbacks, though inseparable from our method, are not the method’s fault. Rather, they are clearly rooted in the preconditions of the neuroses to be treated and would attach themselves to any intensive therapeutic activity aimed at inducing psychological change in the patient.

I found no harm or danger in using hypnosis, even though I made extensive use of it in certain cases. Where harm occurred, the reasons lay elsewhere and were deeper. Reflecting on the therapeutic efforts in these years, since my esteemed teacher and friend Josef Breuer introduced me to the cathartic method, I believe I have benefited far more patients than I harmed and accomplished things that no other therapeutic method could have achieved. Overall, as expressed in the "Preliminary Communication," there has been "a significant therapeutic gain."

<em>Another benefit</em> of applying this method needs to be highlighted. I have found no better way to handle a severe case of complicated neurosis, with varying degrees of hysteria, than by subjecting it to analysis using Breuer's method. The hysterical mechanism is initially addressed, and any remaining symptoms can then be interpreted and traced back to their causes. This provides valuable insights into the appropriate tools for neurosis therapy in each specific case. When I think about the difference in my judgment of a neurosis case before and after such an analysis, I am almost tempted to consider this analysis indispensable for understanding neurotic disorders.

Furthermore, I have adopted the practice of combining cathartic psychotherapy with a rest cure, which can be elaborated into the full Weir Mitchell rest cure if needed. This approach offers the advantage of avoiding the disruption caused by new psychological impressions during psychotherapy. At the same time, it prevents the boredom of the rest cure, which often leads patients to engage in harmful daydreaming. One might expect that the significant psychological work demanded during a cathartic treatment, along with the arousal from recalling traumatic experiences, would conflict with the principles of the Weir Mitchell rest cure and hinder its expected outcomes. However, the opposite is true. Combining Breuer's and Weir Mitchell's therapies achieves all the physical improvements expected from the latter and a level of psychological influence that would never be possible without psychotherapy during the rest cure.

## Further Reflections

Reflecting on my earlier observations, I encountered a challenge when trying to apply Breuer's method more broadly. Some patients diagnosed with hysteria could not be hypnotized, despite the diagnosis suggesting that the psychological mechanism we described should be applicable. Since I needed hypnosis to expand the memory to find pathologenic memories missing from ordinary consciousness, I faced a dilemma: should I give up on these patients or find another way to achieve this memory expansion?

I was just as uncertain as others about why some people could be hypnotized while others could not. Thus, I could not pursue a causal method to resolve the difficulty. I noticed that, for some patients, the obstacle appeared even earlier; they refused to even attempt hypnosis. At one point, I considered that both cases might be identical and signify a refusal, whether explicitly expressed or not. Perhaps those who could not be hypnotized had a psychological resistance to hypnosis. I am still not certain if this view is correct.

Nonetheless, it was necessary to bypass hypnosis and still obtain the pathogenic memories.
I reached this understanding in the following way: When I first met with my patients, I would ask if they remembered the initial trigger for their symptoms. Some would say they knew nothing, while others would offer vague memories they couldn’t develop further. Following Bernheim’s example of retrieving supposedly forgotten impressions from sleepwalking, I would press them, reassuring them that they would remember, encouraging them to think back (cf. [1895 d] p. 167 ff.). Eventually, some recalled something, while others extended their memories a bit further.

I then became more insistent, asking the patients to lie down and willingly close their eyes to "concentrate," which resembled hypnosis to some extent. I noticed that, even without actual hypnosis, new and older memories emerged—memories likely related to our discussion. These experiences led me to believe that it might indeed be possible to uncover the buried pathogenic ideas just by insisting. This insistence felt like an effort on my part, suggesting that I was overcoming a form of resistance. From this, I theorized that my psychological work had to overcome a mental force in the patient that was blocking the awareness (recall) of these harmful ideas.

A new understanding seemed to dawn on me when I considered that this might be the same mental force that had originally contributed to the formation of the hysterical symptoms and had prevented the harmful idea from becoming conscious. What kind of force could be effective here, and what motivation could have activated it? It was easy for me to form an opinion on this, as I had already analyzed several cases where I encountered harmful, forgotten, and unconscious ideas. 

From these cases, I noticed a common characteristic among such ideas: they were all distressing in nature, capable of provoking feelings of shame, guilt, and emotional pain—experiences people would rather not have and prefer to forget. This naturally suggested the idea of repression. Psychologists generally agree that the acceptance of a new idea (in terms of believing in its reality) depends on the nature and orientation of the ideas already combined in the self. They have created specific technical terms for the censorship process new arriving ideas undergo.

An idea had approached the patient's self that proved incompatible, triggering a defensive reaction from the self aimed at repelling this incompatible idea. This defense succeeded in pushing the idea out of conscious awareness and memory, making its mental trace seemingly unfindable. Yet, this trace had to exist. When I tried to focus attention on it, I sensed the same resistance force that had shown itself as repulsion during the symptom’s genesis. If I could demonstrate that the idea became pathogenic due to its expulsion and repression, the chain seemed complete. 

I have discussed these psychological hypotheses and tried to illustrate this connection—the fact of conversion—in several case reports and in a brief paper on the defense neuropsychoses (1894).
A psychological force—the self's aversion—initially pushed the pathogenic thought out of association and now opposed its return to memory. So, the lack of awareness in hysterical individuals was essentially a more or less conscious decision not to know. The therapist's task, then, was to overcome this resistance to association through psychological work. This effort began with "urging," applying a psychological pressure to direct the patient’s attention to the sought-after memory traces. However, this process is not limited to urging and, as I will show, takes on different forms throughout the analysis, calling upon other psychological forces for help.

I will first dwell on the concept of urging. Simply assuring the patient, "You know it, just say it, it will come to you,” does not get you very far. After a few sentences, even a patient in "concentration" loses the train of thought. It’s essential to remember that this involves a quantitative comparison—a battle between various strong or intense motives. In a serious case of hysteria, the resistance to association cannot be matched by the urging of an unfamiliar and unknowing therapist. Thus, stronger methods are required.

I then use a small technical trick. I inform the patient that I will press on their forehead in a moment and assure them that during this entire pressure, they will see a memory as an image before them or have a thought come to mind. I obligate them to share this image or thought with me, whatever it may be. They must not keep it to themselves, even if they think it isn’t what we’re looking for or if it is too uncomfortable to say. No criticism, no holding back, neither from emotion nor from disdain! Only in this way could we find what we’re searching for, and find it infallibly.

Then I press on the patient's forehead for a few seconds, release, and calmly ask, as if disappointment were impossible: "What did you see?" or "What came to mind?"

This method has taught me a lot and consistently led to successful outcomes; I can no longer do without it. I know, of course, that I could replace the pressure on the forehead with some other signal or physical influence on the patient. However, as the patient lies before me, pressing on their forehead or holding their head between my hands proves to be the most suggestive and convenient action I can take for this purpose. To explain its effectiveness, I might say it corresponds to a "momentarily intensified hypnosis," but the mechanism of hypnosis is so mysterious to me that I prefer not to rely on it for explanations. Instead, I believe the advantage of this method lies in dissociating the patient's attention from their conscious searching and thinking—from everything their will can manifest. This is similar to what happens when staring into a crystal ball or something similar.

The lesson I draw from the fact that what I seek always emerges under the pressure of my hand is this: the supposedly forgotten pathogenic idea is always "nearby," accessible through easily reached associations. It is only a matter of removing some obstacle. This obstacle seems to be the person's will, and individuals learn with varying degrees of ease to relinquish their deliberateness and observe their internal psychological processes completely objectively.

It isn't always a "forgotten" memory that emerges under hand pressure. In the rarest cases are the truly pathogenic memories so easily found on the surface. Much more frequently, an idea arises that acts as an intermediary link between the initial idea and the sought-after pathogenic idea in the chain of associations or an idea that serves as the starting point for a new series of thoughts and memories, at the end of which the pathogenic idea lies. Although the pressure may not reveal the pathogenic idea—which would be incomprehensible without context and preparation—it does show the way to it and indicate the direction in which the research should proceed. The idea awakened by the pressure can correspond to a well-known, never-repressed memory. Where the connection to the pathogenic idea breaks off, repeating the procedure—the pressure—will provide a new orientation and connection.

In other cases, the pressure of the hand brings up a memory that is well-known to the patient yet surprises them by its appearance because they have forgotten its relation to the initial idea. As the analysis progresses, this relationship is then proven. From all these results of pressing, one gets the deceptive impression of a superior intelligence outside the patient's consciousness that keeps a vast amount of psychic material organized for specific purposes and arranges its return to consciousness in a meaningful way. However, I suspect this unconscious, second intelligence is just an illusion.
In every complex analysis, I repeatedly, and almost continuously, use a particular technique: the pressure on the forehead. This method either helps continue the patient's conscious recollections from where they left off, highlights connections that had been forgotten, brings to light memories that had been inaccessible for years (but still recognizable as memories), or reveals thoughts the patient refuses to acknowledge as their own. Although they don't remember these thoughts, they must accept that the context demands them and recognizes that precisely these thoughts bring the analysis to completion and end the symptoms.

I want to share some examples of the remarkable outcomes achieved with this technique. I treated a young girl suffering from an unbearable nervous cough that had persisted for six years. The cough seemed to be fueled by every common cold, but it clearly had strong psychological roots. All other therapies had failed, so I attempted to resolve the symptom through psychological analysis. 

She remembered that her nervous cough began when she was fourteen and staying with an aunt. She claimed not to recall any psychological disturbances from that time and did not believe her condition had any underlying motive. Under the pressure of my hand, she first remembered a large dog. She recognized the image—it was her aunt's dog that had become her close companion, following her everywhere. Then, without further prompting, she recalled that the dog had died, that the children had given it a solemn burial, and that her cough started on the way back from this burial. I asked why the cough started, and had to press again. She then had the thought: "Now I am completely alone in the world. No one loves me here; this animal was my only friend, and now I've lost it."

She continued her story: "The cough went away when I left my aunt's place, but it came back a year and a half later." I asked the reason for its return. She initially did not know, so I pressed again. She remembered receiving news of her uncle's death, which caused the cough to resurface, accompanied by a similar thought process. The uncle was supposedly the only family member who loved her, cared for her. This became the pathogenic idea: that no one loved her, that everyone preferred others over her, and that she did not deserve to be loved. There was something significant tied to the idea of "love" which raised considerable resistance when she started to articulate it. The analysis ended before we could fully clarify this.

Some time ago, I was tasked with helping an older woman overcome her anxiety attacks. Based on her personality traits, she seemed highly resistant to such influence. Since menopause, she had become excessively devout, greeting me each time with an ivory crucifix hidden in her hand, as if to ward off evil. Her anxiety attacks, which were hysterical in nature, dated back to her early girlhood and were allegedly triggered by the use of an iodine preparation intended to reduce a mild thyroid swelling. Naturally, I dismissed this explanation and sought to replace it with one that better aligned with my views on the etiology of neurotic symptoms.

When I first asked her about a childhood memory that might be causally linked to her anxiety attacks, she recalled, under the pressure of my hand, reading a so-called devotional book. This book, infused with pietistic references to sexual matters, made a contrary impression on her. The young girl burst into tears and threw the book away. This occurred before her first anxiety attack.

A second pressure on her forehead conjured another memory—this time, of a tutor for her brothers for whom she had felt a warm emotion. This memory culminated in the recollection of an evening at the family home. They all sat around the table, engaging in stimulating conversation. That night, she experienced her first anxiety attack, which was likely more related to her internal struggle against a sensual impulse than to the iodine she had used around the same time. 

How else could I have hoped to uncover such a connection in this obstinate patient, who was so resistant to both me and any worldly therapy, going against her own beliefs and assertions?

Another time, I dealt with a young, happily married woman who, during her early girlhood, had been found every morning in a state of stupor—stiff limbs, open mouth, and protruding tongue. Now, she was experiencing similar, though less severe, episodes upon waking. A deep hypnosis proved unreachable, so I began by exploring her state of concentration. I assured her that she would now see something directly related to the causes of her childhood condition. She calmly and willingly recalled the house where she spent her early years, her room, the position of her bed, her grandmother who lived with them, and a governess she had loved dearly. Several insignificant scenes with these people followed, concluding with the governess's departure from the house to get married. I could not make any connection between these memories and the cause of her episodes, though it was clear that the episodes first appeared around the same time.

Before continuing the analysis, I had the chance to speak with a colleague who had been the family doctor during those years. He provided the following explanation: While treating the girl during her initial episodes, he noticed an excessive fondness between her and the governess. He grew suspicious and asked the grandmother to monitor their interactions. Soon, the grandmother reported that the governess frequently visited the girl's bed at night, and the girl was consistently found in an episode the following morning. They quickly and quietly arranged for this harmful governess to be removed, with the children and even the mother being led to believe that she was leaving to be married.

The successful therapy initially consisted of sharing this explanation with the young woman.

Occasionally, the insights gained through the pressure technique come in unusual forms and under circumstances that suggest the existence of an unconscious intelligence. For instance, I recall a woman who had suffered from obsessive thoughts and phobias for many years and traced the origin of her condition back to childhood but could not identify anything specific to blame. She was sincere and intelligent, showing remarkably little conscious resistance. (Here, I interject that the psychological mechanism of obsessive thoughts has a strong inner connection with that of hysterical symptoms, and the technique of analysis is the same for both.)
When I asked this woman if she felt any sensation or had a memory surface under the pressure of my hand, she replied, "Neither, but a word suddenly came to mind." "Just one word?” I asked. "Yes, but it sounds too silly," she responded. "Tell me anyway," I encouraged. She hesitated, then said, "Janitor." "Nothing else?" I probed. "No," she confirmed. I pressed a second time, and once again, a single word flashed through her mind: "Shirt."

Realizing this was a novel way of responding, I continued with the repeated pressure, eliciting a seemingly meaningless string of words: "Janitor – Shirt – Bed – City – Cart." "What does that mean?" I asked. She pondered for a moment before remembering, "That can only be the story that comes to mind now. When I was ten and my slightly older sister was twelve, she had a violent fit at night and had to be tied up and taken to the city on a cart. I distinctly recall that it was the janitor who subdued her and accompanied her to the institution."

I continued using this method and received other sequences of words, many of which I couldn't interpret. However, they still advanced the story and connected to a second narrative. The significance of this memory soon became clear. The sister's illness had deeply impacted her because they shared a secret; they had both been subjected to sexual assaults by a certain male figure one night while sleeping in the same room. By mentioning this early sexual trauma, not only the origins of the first obsessive thoughts were revealed, but also the later trauma that influenced her pathology.

The peculiarity of this case lay in the appearance of individual key words that we had to piece together into sentences. The apparent lack of connection and coherence was prevalent in all the ideas and scenes that emerged under pressure, similar to these oracularly revealed words. Further investigation regularly showed that these seemingly unrelated reminiscences were tightly linked by associations, directly leading to the sought pathogenic moment.

I fondly remember another case of analysis where my trust in the results of pressure was first severely tested, but then splendidly justified. A very intelligent and seemingly very happy young woman consulted me due to a persistent abdominal pain that resisted therapy. I identified that the pain was located in the abdominal walls, specifically in palpable muscle knots, and prescribed local treatment.
Months later, I saw the patient again. She told me, "The pain I had back then went away after the recommended treatment and stayed gone for a long time. But now it's come back as a nervous issue. I can tell because I no longer feel it with movement like before, but at specific times, like in the mornings when I wake up, or during certain kinds of stress." 

Her diagnosis was accurate. The task now was to find the cause of this pain, but she couldn't help identify it in her normal state. In a state of concentration and under the pressure of my hand, when I asked if anything came to mind or if she saw anything, she chose to describe her visual images.

She described something like a sun with rays, which I initially thought was a phosphene, caused by pressure on the eyes. I expected more useful images to follow, but instead she continued describing stars with a pale blue light, similar to moonlight, and other flickering, glowing points of light before her eyes. I started to consider this attempt a failure and wondered how to gracefully exit the situation. That’s when one of the images she described caught my attention: a large black cross, tilted, with the same moonlit glow at the edges as the previous images, and a small flame flickering on its beams. This was evidently not just a phosphene.

Now truly listening, I noted she continued to describe numerous images in the same light: peculiar symbols resembling Sanskrit characters, triangles, including a large one, and again, the cross. Suspecting an allegorical significance this time, I asked, "What does this cross represent?"

"It likely means the pain," she replied.

I pointed out that "cross" usually refers to a moral burden and asked what might be hiding behind the pain. She couldn't explain and continued with her visions: a sun with golden rays, which she identified as God, the primal force; then a gigantic lizard, which she looked at quizzically but without fear; then a pile of snakes; and once again, a sun, but this time with gentle silver rays. Between herself and this light source was a grid that blocked the center of the sun.

I quickly realized I was dealing with allegories, so I immediately asked about the meaning of the last image. She responded without hesitation: "The sun represents perfection, the ideal, and the bars symbolize my weaknesses and mistakes that stand between me and the ideal." 

"Do you blame yourself then? Are you dissatisfied with yourself?" I asked.

"Of course," she replied.

"Since when?"

"Since I joined the Theosophical Society and started reading the publications they put out. I've always had a low opinion of myself."

"What has made the strongest impression on you lately?"

"A translation from Sanskrit that's being published in installments," she said.

A minute later, I was initiated into her inner turmoil and the self-reproach she felt. She recounted a minor event that triggered her guilt, where her previous physical pain first appeared as a result of an emotional conversion. The images I initially took for phosphene were actually symbols of occultist ideas, perhaps even straight from the covers of occultist books.

I have now praised the auxiliary procedure of pressing so highly and neglected the entire concept of defense or resistance so much that I must have given the impression that this small trick puts one in a position to easily overcome the psychological obstacle to a cathartic cure. But believing this would be a grave mistake; such benefits don't exist in therapy, as far as I can see; significant change requires significant effort here, as it does everywhere. The pressing procedure is nothing more than a ploy to catch the defensive self off guard for a moment. In all serious cases, the self soon regains its focus and resumes its resistance.

I have observed various forms in which this resistance appears. Usually, during the first or second attempt, the pressure technique fails. The patient often expresses great disappointment, saying: "I thought something would come to mind, but all I could think about was how eager I was for it to happen; nothing came up." This initial reaction of the patient doesn't count as a real obstacle yet. You simply say: "You were too curious this time; it’ll work better the next time." And it usually does.

It's fascinating how completely patients—even the most compliant and intelligent ones—can forget the agreement they previously understood and accepted. They promised to say everything that comes to mind under the pressure of the hand, regardless of whether it seems relevant or pleasant to mention, without any filtering, without being influenced by criticism or emotion. However, they don't stick to this promise. It’s evidently beyond their capacity. The work frequently halts, and they repeatedly claim that nothing came to mind. You shouldn't believe this; instead, assume and express that they are withholding something because they either deem it insignificant or find it embarrassing. Persist, repeat the pressure, and remain unwavering until you actually hear something. Then they often add:

Patient: I could have told you this the first time. 

Freud: Why didn't you say it then? 

Patient: I couldn't believe that it would be relevant. Only when it kept coming back did I decide to mention it. 

Or: I hoped that wasn't it; I thought I could spare myself from saying it. Only when I couldn't suppress it any longer did I realize that I wouldn't be gifted anything easily.

Thus, the patient later reveals the motives of a resistance they initially didn’t want to acknowledge. They evidently can't help but resist.

It is curious how resistance often hides behind various excuses. Phrases like, "I'm distracted today," or "The clock or the piano playing in the next room is bothering me," are common. I've learned to respond with: "Not at all, you're encountering something you don't want to talk about. That won't help you. Just stay with it." The longer the pause between my prompt and the patient's response, the more suspicious I become. It suggests the patient is possibly editing their thoughts and may distort the memory when they finally express it. 

Crucial insights often come with dismissive remarks, much like disguised royalty in operas: "Something came to mind, but it has nothing to do with it. I'm telling you only because you want to know everything." This introduction usually precedes the long-awaited solution. I always pay close attention when a patient speaks dismissively about a thought. It's a sign of successful defense mechanisms. Pathogenic thoughts might seem insignificant upon resurfacing because the process of repression weakens them—stripping them of their emotional impact.

You can recognize pathogenic memories by how patients describe them as unimportant while still expressing noticeable resistance. Sometimes, patients might even deny the memory when it resurfaces: "Something came to mind, but you must have planted that idea," or "I know what you're expecting from this question. You probably think I had this or that thought." An especially clever form of denial is saying, "Something has come to mind, but it seems like I added it arbitrarily; it doesn’t feel like a genuine recollection."

In all these situations, I remain unwavering. I ignore these distinctions and explain to the patient that these are merely forms and excuses for resisting the reproduction of certain memories. Nonetheless, we must acknowledge these memories.

When it comes to the recurrence of images, it's generally easier to work with than recurring thoughts. Hysterics, who are mostly visual thinkers, make the analyst's job easier than those with obsessive thoughts. Once an image surfaces from memory, you may hear the patient say that it starts to crumble and become unclear as they continue to describe it. The patient essentially deconstructs the image by verbalizing it. You use the memory image itself to guide the direction of the ongoing work. "Look at the image again. Is it gone?" – "Overall, yes, but I still see this detail." – "Then it still has significance. You'll either see something new or recall something related to this detail." When the work is finished, the mental landscape is clear again, and another image can be elicited. At other times, an image stubbornly remains in the patient's mind despite their description, indicating that there's something important they haven't yet shared about the theme of the image. Once they articulate this, the image fades away, like a spirit finding peace.

It's crucial for the progress of the analysis to prove right to the patient each time, otherwise, you rely on what they deem worthy to share. It's comforting to know that the procedure of pressing never really fails, except for one case that I’ll discuss later, which is marked by a special motive for resistance. It can happen, of course, that the procedure is used in circumstances where it’s not supposed to reveal anything. For instance, if you ask about the further etiology of a symptom when it's already fully established, or inquire about the psychological genealogy of a symptom, like a pain that’s actually somatic. In these cases, the patient correctly claims they have nothing to add. You'll avoid wrongfully discrediting them by consistently keeping an eye on the calm expression during analysis. You’ll easily learn to distinguish genuine psychic calm, where no reminiscence is present, from the tension and emotional signs when the patient is trying to suppress emerging memories due to resistance. These experiences underpin the differential diagnostic application of the pressing procedure.

Working with the pressure technique is not an effortless task. The only advantage gained is that one learns from the outcomes of this method in which direction to investigate and which matters to confront the patient with. In some cases, this is sufficient. The essential point is for me to guess the secret and directly confront the patient with it; they then usually drop their denial. However, in other cases, more is needed. The patient's persistent resistance manifests in disconnected associations, lack of resolutions, and unclear or incomplete recollections.

Often, when reflecting on earlier stages of an analysis from a later period, one is surprised by how fragmented all the ideas and scenes extracted through the pressure procedure were. They often lack the essential element—the connection to a person or topic—rendering the image incomprehensible. I'll give one or two examples of how such censorship works when pathogenic memories first emerge. The patient, for instance, sees a female torso with a gap in the fabric, seemingly due to negligence. Only much later do they add the head to this torso, revealing a person and a relationship. 

Or they recount a childhood memory of two boys whose forms are vague, with a certain mischief attributed to them. It takes many months and significant progress in the analysis before they revisit this memory and recognize themselves in one of the children and their brother in the other.

So, what means do we have at our disposal to overcome this persistent resistance?
### Techniques for Managing Psychological Resistance

It’s rare but nearly universal that individuals influence others through a psychological effect. First, it must be acknowledged that psychological resistance, especially one that has been established over a long period, can only be dismantled slowly and incrementally, requiring considerable patience.

Next, one can count on the emergence of intellectual interest in the patient after a brief period of work. By enlightening the patient and sharing insights about the fascinating world of psychological processes—insights that the analyst has themselves only gained through such analyses—the patient becomes an active collaborator. They begin to view themselves with the objective interest of a researcher, thus diminishing resistance based on emotional grounds.

Lastly, but most critically, one must attempt to devalue the motives behind the patient’s defense mechanisms, or even replace them with stronger ones, once they have been identified. This is where the therapeutic process becomes less formulaic. An analyst works in various roles: as an educator when ignorance has caused fear, as a teacher, as an advocate of a freer or more enlightened worldview, or as a confessor who grants absolution by maintaining their interest and respect after a confession. The analyst tries to provide human support, as much as their personality and the empathy they can muster for the case allow.

An indispensable prerequisite for this psychological activity is a rough understanding of the nature of the case and the motivations behind the defenses at play. Fortunately, the technique of probing and applying pressure helps to some extent in gaining this understanding. The more such puzzles an analyst has already solved, the easier it becomes to decode a new one, allowing them to commence the actual healing work sooner.

It’s crucial to understand this fully: even if the patient only rids themselves of hysterical symptoms by recalling and expressing the pathogenic impressions causing them, the therapeutic task lies solely in motivating the patient to do so. Once this task is achieved, there is nothing left for the analyst to correct or remove. All necessary counter-suggestions are already applied during the efforts to overcome resistance. The situation is akin to unlocking a door; once the key has turned, pressing down the handle poses no more difficulty.

In addition to intellectual motives used to overcome resistance, an emotional element—the personal influence of the analyst—is often indispensable. In many cases, this alone can dissolve resistance. This is not different from other areas of medicine, and no therapeutic method can be expected to entirely forgo the benefit of this personal factor.

Given the challenges of my technique that I've laid bare in the preceding section—although I should mention that many times it can go much more conveniently—one might rightly question whether it wouldn't be more efficient to emphasize hypnosis or limit the cathartic method to patients who can be deeply hypnotized. To the latter suggestion, I must respond that it would drastically reduce the number of patients suitable for my skills. However, to the former advice, I hypothesize that forcing hypnosis might not significantly alleviate resistance.

Interestingly, my experiences on this matter are quite limited, so I can't move beyond conjecture. But whenever I've conducted a cathartic treatment during hypnosis instead of through concentration, I didn't find my workload reduced. I recently completed such a treatment where I alleviated a hysterical paralysis of the legs. The patient entered a state markedly different from wakefulness, characterized by an inability to open her eyes or rise until prompted with the command, "Now wake up." Yet, I encountered no greater resistance in this case than in others. 

I didn't place much importance on these physical signs, and by the end of the ten-month treatment, they had almost vanished. During our sessions, the patient's condition retained its unique qualities, such as the ability to recall the unconscious and her particular relationship to me, the analyst. In the case of Mrs. Emmy v. N., I documented an example of a cathartic cure executed in deep somnambulism, where resistance was minimal. However, I didn't uncover anything from her that required significant overcoming to share—nothing she wouldn't have told me in a state of wakefulness with longer acquaintance and some respect.

I couldn't identify the actual causes of her illness, which were likely the same as the causes of her relapses post-treatment—this was my first attempt at this therapy. When I demanded a reminiscence involving an erotic element, her resistance and unreliability in providing details were similar to any of my non-somnambulant patients. I already mentioned her resistance in somnambulism to other demands and expectations in her case history. Overall, the value of hypnosis for facilitating cathartic cures has become doubtful to me after witnessing absolute therapeutic uncooperativeness despite excellent obedience in deep somnambulism. I've shared a brief case of this kind on page 156f of [1895 d]; there are more I could add.

I must admit that these experiences have satisfied my need for a quantitative relation between cause and effect in the psychological realm.

### Resistance and Hysteria: A Dual Perspective

In our current discussion, the concept of resistance has come to the forefront. I have shown how therapeutic work leads to the understanding that hysteria arises from the repression of an intolerable idea as a defensive measure. This repressed idea remains as a faint (low-intensity) memory trace, and the affect associated with it is redirected towards a somatic innervation—thus, we have a conversion of arousal. Therefore, the idea, by being repressed, becomes the cause of pathological symptoms, making it pathogenic. We can call hysteria that displays this psychological mechanism "defense hysteria."

Breuer and I have repeatedly spoken of two other types of hysteria, which we have termed "hypnoid hysteria" and "retention hysteria." Hypnoid hysteria is the first type we encountered, and the best example of this is Breuer's initial case. For hypnoid hysteria, Breuer proposed a psychological mechanism different from that of conversion defense. Here, an idea becomes pathogenic because, received in a particular psychological state, it remains outside the self from the outset. It doesn't need any psychological force to keep it from the self, and it should not provoke resistance when reintroduced into the self through somnambulistic mental activity. The case history of Anna O. indeed shows no signs of such resistance.

I consider this difference essential, enough to hold onto the classification of hypnoid hysteria. Interestingly, I haven't encountered a genuine hypnoid hysteria in my own experience; everything I dealt with turned into defense hysteria. It's not that I never dealt with symptoms originating in isolated states of consciousness and thus excluded from the self. This was sometimes the case in my instances, too. However, I could still demonstrate that the so-called hypnoid state owed its isolation to the prior splitting off of a psychic group due to defense mechanisms. In short, I suspect that hypnoid and defense hysteria intersect somewhere at their root, with defense being the primary factor. But I know nothing definite about this.

Similarly uncertain is my judgment about "retention hysteria," where therapeutic work should also proceed without resistance. I had a case which I considered a typical retention hysteria; I anticipated an easy and definite success, but the success didn't materialize, despite the simplicity of the work. Therefore, I cautiously suspect that even in retention hysteria, a form of defense lies at the core, pushing the entire process towards the hysterical. Whether my tendency to extend the concept of defense to all forms of hysteria risks falling into bias and error, new experiences will hopefully soon clarify.

I have so far discussed the challenges and techniques of the cathartic method, and I would like to add some remarks on how an analysis unfolds using this technique. This is a very interesting topic for me, although I do not expect it to generate similar interest among those who have not yet conducted such an analysis. Essentially, I will be discussing technique again, but this time focusing on the inherent difficulties for which the patient cannot be blamed. These difficulties, partially present in hypnoid and retention hysteria, should be similar to those I observe in defense hysteria, which I consider exemplary. I approach this final section with the expectation that the psychological peculiarities uncovered here might one day provide valuable raw material for a dynamic understanding of ideas.

The first and most powerful impression one gets from such an analysis is that the pathogenic psychological material, which is supposedly forgotten and not accessible to the self, does not play a role in association and memory. However, it is in some way readily available, correctly and properly organized. The challenge is to remove the resistances that block access to it. Once these are removed, the material becomes conscious, similar to how we become aware of anything. The correct connections between individual ideas and non-pathogenic, frequently remembered ones are present, have been established at the time, and are preserved in memory. The pathogenic psychological material appears to belong to an intelligence that does not necessarily fall short of the normal self's. The impression of a second personality is often most convincingly created.

Whether this impression is justified, and whether we might be retroactively placing the arrangement of the psychological material, which results from the resolution, back into the period of illness, are questions I do not wish to consider here and now. The experiences made in such analyses can, in any case, be most conveniently and clearly described from the perspective one takes after the resolution to overview the whole situation.

The situation is often not as simple as presented in special cases—such as a single symptom arising from a major trauma. One typically does not encounter just a single hysterical symptom but rather a number of them, some independent of each other and some interconnected. One should not expect a single traumatic memory and a single pathogenic idea at its core but should instead be prepared for sequences of partial traumas and chains of pathogenic thought processes. Monosymptomatic traumatic hysteria is akin to a simple organism, a single-celled being compared to the complex structure of a severe hysterical neurosis, as we commonly encounter.

The psychological material of such hysteria presents itself as a multidimensional construct with at least three layers. I hope to justify this figurative expression shortly. First, there is a core of memories (of experiences or thought patterns) where the traumatic moment peaked or the pathogenic idea reached its purest form. Surrounding this core, one finds a vast amount of other memories that must be processed during analysis, arranged in three distinct ways.

Firstly, there's a linear, chronological arrangement within each theme. For instance, in Breuer’s analysis of Anna O., he organized the theme of deafness or not hearing into seven conditions, with each heading containing ten to over a hundred individual memories in chronological order. It resembled a well-maintained archive. In my analysis of patient Emmy v. N., there were similar bundles of memories, albeit less numerous. These bundles are a common occurrence in every analysis and always appear in a chronological order as reliable as the sequence of weekdays or month names in a mentally healthy person. This arrangement complicates the analysis as the order of occurrence is reversed in reproduction; the most recent memory of the bundle appears first as a "cover sheet," with the series ending with the initial experience.

I have referred to the grouping of similar memories in a linear manner, like a bundle of records, as forming a theme. These themes show a second type of arrangement; they are layered concentrically around the pathogenic core. It's not hard to explain what constitutes this layering, which follows a pattern of increasing or decreasing resistance. These are layers of equal resistance growing towards the core and zones of equal changes in consciousness, in which the themes extend. The outermost layers contain memories (or bundles) that are easily recalled and always clearly conscious; the deeper one goes, the more challenging it becomes to recognize the emerging memories until, near the core, one encounters memories that the patient still denies during reproduction.

This unique concentric layering of pathogenic psychological material gives these analyses their distinct features, as we will discuss. Now, there is a third type of arrangement to mention, which is essential but the hardest to describe generally. This is the arrangement based on the content of thoughts, the logical thread that reaches down to the core. It may follow unique, irregular, and often twisted paths. This arrangement has a dynamic nature, as opposed to the morphological nature of the first two layers mentioned. While the latter could be represented in a spatial diagram with rigid, arched, and straight lines, the flow of logical connections would need to be traced with a stick that navigates the most intricate paths, moving from superficial to deeper layers and back, generally progressing from the periphery to the central core, touching all necessary points—much like the zigzag path of a chess knight solving a complex puzzle across a chessboard.

I'm holding onto this comparison for a moment to highlight a point where it doesn't quite fit the reality. The logical connection isn't just a zigzagging line but rather a branching, converging system of lines. It has nodes where two or more threads intersect and then continue together towards the core. Usually, multiple independent threads or those connected through side paths converge into the core. It’s very striking, in other words, how often a symptom is multiply determined or overdetermined.

My attempt to illustrate the organization of pathogenic psychological material will be complete once I introduce one more complexity. It may be the case that there is more than one single core in the pathogenic material. For example, if there is a second hysterical episode to analyze, which has its own causes but is also related to an acute hysteria episode overcome years before. One can then easily imagine the additional layers and pathways needed to connect the two pathogenic cores.

I would like to add a few remarks to the picture we've developed of the organization of pathogenic material. We've stated that this material behaves like a foreign body, and that the therapy acts akin to the removal of a foreign body from living tissue. Now, we can see where this comparison falls short. 

A foreign body does not integrate with the surrounding tissue layers, even though it can cause changes and induce reactive inflammation. Our pathogenic psychological group, on the other hand, cannot be neatly separated from the self. Its outer layers blend seamlessly with parts of the normal self, and essentially belong to it just as much as to the pathogenic organization. 

When analyzing, the boundary between the two is quite arbitrary—sometimes placed here, sometimes there—and in some cases, it cannot be precisely defined. The inner layers increasingly estrange themselves from the self, without any visible starting point for the pathogenic boundary. Thus, the pathogenic organization doesn't actually behave like a foreign body but much more like an infiltration. In this analogy, it is the resistance that must be seen as doing the infiltrating. 

Therapy is not about extracting something—psychotherapy today cannot do that—but about melting the resistance to allow circulation into previously blocked areas.

(I am using a series of metaphors here, which all have fairly limited similarities to my topic and are not entirely compatible with each other. I am aware of this and do not risk overestimating their value. My intention is to illustrate an extremely complex and previously unpresented concept from different angles. Therefore, I ask for the freedom to continue using such imperfect comparisons in the following sections.)
**Translation of Freud - Contemporary Readable English (2024):**

If you could show a third party the pathogenic material after completing its intricate, multi-dimensional organization, they might rightly ask, "How did such a camel pass through the eye of a needle?" There is indeed something right about talking about the "narrowness of consciousness." The term gains meaning and vitality for the therapist conducting such an analysis. Only one memory at a time can enter the self-consciousness. The patient, focused on working through one memory, sees nothing of what comes next and forgets what has already emerged. If the processing of this one pathogenic memory encounters difficulties, like when the patient resists it, tries to repress or distort it, a bottleneck is created. Progress stalls, no other memories can come up, and the emerging memory stays with the patient until it is fully integrated into the self. The entire spatial mass of the pathogenic material is drawn through a narrow gap, reaching consciousness in fragmented pieces or bands. It is the psychotherapist’s job to reassemble the presumed organization. For those who like analogies, you might think of it as working through a complex puzzle.

When you're about to begin such an analysis, where you can expect a complex organization of pathogenic material, you can benefit from several proven strategies. It is entirely fruitless to try to approach the core of the pathogenic organization directly. Even if you could guess it accurately, the patient would be unable to do anything with the information and would not experience any psychological change from it.

Therefore, you must start at the periphery of the pathogenic psychic structure. Begin by having the patient share what they know and remember, while you direct their attention and use pressure techniques to overcome minor resistances. Every time you open a new path through applying pressure, you can expect the patient to follow it a bit further without new resistance.

After working in this manner for a while, a cooperative activity usually arises in the patient. They now recall numerous memories spontaneously without needing questions or guidance. You have essentially cleared a path into an inner layer where the patient can now freely access material of the same resistance level. It is wise to let them reproduce memories on their own for a while. Although the patient may not be capable of uncovering significant connections, they can still work through material within the same layer. The things they bring up often seem disconnected but provide content that later reveals meaningful connections.

Generally, you need to guard against two things. If you inhibit the patient from expressing the thoughts that are coming to them, you might miss something important, which will be much harder to uncover later. On the other hand, you must not overestimate the patient's unconscious intelligence and let it take over all the work. If I were to outline the working method, it might be said that you take charge of uncovering deeper layers and making radial progress, while the patient handles the peripheral expansion.

This progress happens by overcoming resistance in the way mentioned before. However, there is usually another task to solve first. You need to grasp a logical thread, guided by which you can hope to penetrate deeper. Don't expect the patient's freely conveyed thoughts, which come from the most superficial layers, to easily reveal where to dig deeper or where the sought-after connections are. On the contrary, these connections are carefully hidden, and the patient's account often seems complete and self-contained. Initially, it feels like facing a wall that blocks all view, giving no clue about what, if anything, might lie behind it.

However, when you critically examine the account received without much effort or resistance, you will inevitably find gaps and flaws. Here, the connection is visibly broken, and the patient uses a phrase or insufficient explanation to fill the gap; there, you encounter a motive that would seem insignificant to a normal person. The patient will not acknowledge these gaps when brought to their attention. But the analyst does well to seek access to the deeper material behind these weak spots, hoping to find the threads of connection to pursue with pressure techniques. You might say to the patient, "You're mistaken; what you're indicating cannot be related to this issue. Here, we must encounter something else that will come to you under the pressure of my hand."

You must hold the same standards of logical connection and sufficient motivation for a thought process in a hysterical person, even if it reaches into the unconscious, as you would for a normal individual. A loosening of these connections is not within the power of the neurosis. If the thought associations of neurotics, especially hysterics, seem different and the relationship of intensities among various ideas appears inexplicable by psychological conditions alone, we've learned the reason for this appearance and can name it as the presence of hidden, unconscious motives. So we can suspect such secret motives wherever there is a break in connection or a leap beyond normal justification.

When working in such a field, one must free themselves from the theoretical prejudice that suggests dealing with abnormal brains of degenerates and unbalanced individuals who supposedly possess an inherent freedom to disregard common psychological laws of thought association as if it were a stigma. According to this view, one idea could grow excessively intense without any motive, while another could remain indestructibly without psychological reason. However, experience shows the opposite for hysteria. Once the hidden—often unconscious—motives are uncovered and accounted for, nothing about the association of thoughts in hysterical cases remains mysterious or abnormal.

This process involves identifying gaps in the patient's initial account, which are often concealed by "false associations." By identifying a piece of the logical thread at the periphery and using pressure techniques from that point, one can proceed further.

It is very rare to follow the same thread all the way to the core. Typically, it breaks midway—either the pressure technique fails, yielding no result or provides an outcome that cannot be clarified or continued despite all efforts. One quickly learns to guard against common confusions in this situation. The patient's demeanor must determine whether one has truly reached an end that requires no further psychological explanation or if overwhelming resistance is halting the process. If the latter cannot be immediately overcome, it can be assumed that the thread has been followed into a layer that remains impenetrable for now. Therefore, one lets it go and picks up another thread, possibly following it as far.

When all threads have been pursued into this deeper layer and the knots preventing further progress have been identified, one can then consider tackling the upcoming resistance once more.

It becomes evident how complicated such work can be. One continually pushes through resistance to reach inner layers, gains knowledge of the themes and threads in that layer, examines how far current means and understanding can take them, gets an initial sense of the next layers' contents using pressure techniques, lets threads go and picks them up again, follows them to knot points, constantly tracks back, and each time a memory bundle is followed, one ends up on a side path that eventually converges again. Finally, one reaches a stage where they can abandon the layer-by-layer approach and directly advance along a main path to the core of the pathogenic organization.

At this point, the battle is won, but the process is not yet finished. One must retrieve the other threads and exhaust the material. However, now the patient actively assists; their resistance is usually already broken.
### Translation: Later Stages of Analytical Work

In the later stages of the analytic process, it can be beneficial to guess the connections and share hypotheses with the patient before the actual discovery. If your guess is accurate, it speeds up the analysis. Even if the hypothesis is incorrect, it helps by compelling the patient to take a stance, often prompting firm rejections that indicate a deeper knowledge.

You might find, to your astonishment, that you can't force information onto the patient about things they supposedly don't know. Nor can you alter the outcomes of the analysis by creating expectations. I have never successfully changed or falsified the reproduction of memories or the sequence of events through my predictions. Any correct prediction has always been verified by multiple undisputed reminiscences, proving I had guessed correctly. Therefore, there is no harm in sharing your thoughts on the likely connections with the patient; it does no damage.

Another observation that can be consistently repeated involves the patient's independent recollections. You can assert that every memory emerging during such an analysis holds significance. Memories unrelated to the important ones by association simply do not appear. You might only consider exceptions for seemingly unimportant memories that are essential connective pieces in associating two meaningful recollections. 

The duration a memory lingers in the patient's conscious bottleneck is directly related to its significance. A persistent image demands further consideration; a thought that won't go away requires continued pursuit. Once a reminiscence is resolved, it never reappears. If it does, it’s a sign that a new thought or conclusion is now attached to it, indicating the previous resolution was incomplete. A memory might return with varying intensity—first as a hint, then in full clarity—which does not contradict the mentioned observation.

### Symptom Engagement During Psychoanalysis

When the task of alleviating a symptom features prominently in the analysis—specifically symptoms capable of increasing in intensity or recurring (such as pain, irritative symptoms like vomiting, sensations, or contractions)—an intriguing and beneficial phenomenon often takes place during the work: the symptom engages with the process. This particular symptom reappears or intensifies as soon as we approach the pathogenic area responsible for it. It then accompanies the therapy with notable and educational fluctuations for the analyst.

For instance, the intensity of a symptom like the urge to vomit increases the deeper we delve into the specific pathogenic memories. It reaches its peak just before the patient articulates these memories. Upon fully verbalizing them, the symptom's intensity drops suddenly or even disappears for a moment. If a patient resists verbalizing for an extended period, the sensation—such as the urge to vomit—can become unbearable, and actual vomiting may occur. This provides a clear impression that the act of vomiting substitutes a mental action (in this case, verbalizing), as per the conversion theory of hysteria.

These intensity fluctuations of the hysterical symptom repeat each time we tackle a new pathogenic memory. The symptom remains persistently in play. Should we need to momentarily drop the thread connecting to this symptom, it recedes into the background, only to resurface at a later stage of the analysis. This process continues until the pathogenic material responsible for the symptom is thoroughly addressed and resolved.

In essence, the hysterical symptom behaves no differently than a memory or thought the patient recalls under the prompting of an analyst. Both exhibit the same obsessive persistence, demanding resolution. The only difference is the seemingly spontaneous emergence of hysterical symptoms, while we remember provoking the scenes and ideas ourselves. In reality, there is an unbroken continuum from these unchanged memory residues of emotional experiences and thoughts to the hysterical symptoms, which serve as their memory symbols.

<strong>The Phenomenon of Symptom Recurrence During Analysis</strong>

The phenomenon of hysterical symptoms reappearing during analysis presents a practical challenge that the patient needs to come to terms with. It's virtually impossible to analyze a symptom in one continuous session or to time the pauses in the work to coincide perfectly with natural stopping points. Instead, interruptions—whether due to treatment circumstances, scheduling constraints, or other factors—often occur at the most inconvenient moments, just as a decision seems imminent or a new topic emerges. This is similar to how newspaper readers are frustrated by the daily interruption in the serialized novel, where just after a pivotal speech by the heroine or a gunshot, it ends with "To be continued."

In our case, the stirred-up but unresolved topic, and the thus intensified yet unexplained symptom, remain in the patient's mind, possibly bothering them more than before. This is something one just has to accept; it can’t be managed otherwise. There are patients who can’t let go of a topic once it’s been touched upon during such analysis. They are obsessed with it even during the intervals between sessions, and since they can’t resolve it alone, they initially suffer more than before the treatment. However, even these patients eventually learn to wait for the analyst, channeling all their focus on resolving the pathogenic material during the treatment hours. They then begin to feel more at ease in the intervals between sessions.

<strong>General Well-being of Patients During Analysis</strong>

The general well-being of patients during such analysis also merits attention. For a while, it remains uninfluenced by the treatment, reflecting the effects of previously active factors. But eventually, a moment arrives when the patient's interest is captivated, and from then on, their overall state increasingly depends on the progress of the work. Each time a new insight is achieved or an important part of the analysis is reached, the patient feels relieved, experiencing a preview of the impending liberation. Conversely, when the work stalls or confusion looms, the psychological burden grows, increasing their feelings of distress and incapacity. However, these effects are usually short-lived because the analysis continues, disregarding fleeting moments of well-being and moving steadily through periods of difficulty.

Analysts generally find it satisfactory when they replace spontaneous mood swings in patients with ones they themselves provoke and understand. Similarly, they prefer to see the natural resolution of symptoms replaced by a schedule that aligns with the progress of the analysis.

Usually, the work becomes darker and more difficult the deeper one delves into the previously described layered psychological structures. However, once you reach the core, it becomes clearer, and the patient's overall condition no longer fears significant deterioration. The reward for this hard work—the cessation of symptoms—can only be expected after a full analysis for each individual symptom. When symptoms are interconnected through multiple links, partial successes during the process may not even be encouraging. Due to the abundance of causal connections, every unresolved pathogenic idea can act as a motivation for all neurotic manifestations. Only with the last word of the analysis does the entire illness vanish, much like the individual reproduced memory behaved.

When a pathogenic memory or connection, previously hidden from the self-awareness, is uncovered and integrated through the work of analysis, we observe various ways in which the now enriched psyche expresses its gains. Often, after being painstakingly led to some insight, patients declare, “I’ve always known that; I could have told you this before.” The more insightful among them recognize this as self-deception and admit their lack of appreciation. Generally, the self’s response to new discoveries depends on the layer of analysis they come from. Materials from the outer layers are easily acknowledged because they were already within the self's possession—only their connection to deeper layers of pathogenic material was new. Discoveries from deeper layers are also recognized but usually after hesitation and reflection. Visual memory images are, of course, harder to deny than traces of mere thought processes. It is not uncommon for a patient to initially say, “It’s possible I thought this, but I can’t remember,” and only after prolonged familiarity with the idea does recognition follow; they remember and confirm through related connections that they indeed had this thought.

During analysis, I make it a rule to assess the value of emerging memories independently of the patient's acknowledgment. I constantly repeat that we are bound to accept everything that our methods uncover. If something false or incorrect appeared, the context would later rule it out. Incidentally, I have rarely had reason to retroactively withdraw recognition from a preliminarily accepted memory. Whatever emerged has ultimately proven to be correct, despite seemingly compelling contradictions.

The deepest thoughts, which are at the core of the pathogenic organization, are also the hardest for patients to acknowledge as memories. Even when the process is complete, and patients are intellectually convinced and have experienced the healing effects that accompany the emergence of these thoughts, they often still add: "But I can't remember thinking that." It becomes easy to communicate with them at this point: these were unconscious thoughts. But how should one incorporate this fact into their psychological understanding? Should we overlook this denied recognition by the patients, which is otherwise unmotivated after the work is done, or should we assume that these were indeed thoughts that never fully formed, only existing as possibilities, making the therapy the execution of a previously omitted psychological act?

It is clearly impossible to make any statements about the condition of the pathogenic material before analysis without thoroughly clarifying one's fundamental psychological views, especially regarding the nature of consciousness. A noteworthy fact remains: in such analyses, one can trace a thought process from conscious awareness into the unconscious—where it is not recognized as a memory—then pull it partway back through the conscious mind, only to see it end in the unconscious again, without this shift in "psychic illumination" altering the thought's coherence or the connection of its parts. Once I fully comprehend this thought process, I couldn't guess which part the patient recognized as a memory and which they did not. I can somewhat observe the tips of the thought process dipping into the unconscious, contrary to how our normal psychological processes are described.

I have one more topic to address, which plays an undesirably large role in conducting such a cathartic analysis. I have already acknowledged the possibility that the pressure technique might fail despite all assurances and urging, bringing up no reminiscences. In such cases, I mentioned two possibilities: either there is indeed nothing to uncover at that particular place, which is evident from the patient's completely calm demeanor, or one encounters a resistance that can only be overcome later, standing before a new layer they cannot yet access, readable from the patient’s tense and effortful expression. However, there is also a third possibility, which represents an external rather than a content-related obstacle. This occurs when the relationship between the patient and the therapist is disturbed, which constitutes the worst obstacle one could face. Yet, one can expect this in any serious analysis.

I've already hinted at the significant role the therapist's personality plays in creating motivations that help overcome the psychological strength of resistance. In not a few cases, especially with women and when it comes to clarifying erotic thoughts, the patient’s cooperation becomes a personal sacrifice that must be compensated with some substitute for love. The therapist’s effort and patient kindness must suffice as that substitute.

When this relationship between the patient and the therapist is disrupted, the patient’s willingness to cooperate also fails. When the therapist inquires about the next pathogenic idea, the patient’s awareness of complaints against the therapist intervenes. From what I have experienced, this obstacle arises in three main scenarios:

1. Personal alienation: when the patient feels neglected, undervalued, insulted, or has heard unfavorable things about the therapist and the treatment method. This is the least serious case; the obstacle can be easily overcome through discussion and clarification, although the sensitivity and suspicion of hysterical patients can occasionally manifest in unexpected ways.

2. Fear of dependence: when the patient becomes afraid that she might grow too attached to the therapist, lose her independence, or even become sexually dependent on them. This case is more significant because it is less individually conditioned. The cause of this obstacle lies in the nature of therapeutic concern. The patient now has a new reason for resistance, which manifests not only in certain memories but in every treatment attempt. Commonly, the patient complains of headaches when the therapist applies pressure techniques. This new resistance motive usually remains unconscious to her, and she expresses it through a newly created hysterical symptom. The headache signifies her reluctance to be influenced.

If a patient becomes frightened that their embarrassing thoughts emerging from analysis are being projected onto the analyst, this is quite common and even regularly occurs in certain analyses. This projection onto the analyst happens through a false association, as discussed previously ([1895 d] p.121). I'll provide an example here: One of my patients developed a certain hysterical symptom from a wish she had many years ago, which was immediately repressed into her unconscious. She wished that a man she was conversing with would suddenly grab her and force a kiss on her. After one session, a similar wish emerged towards me; she was horrified by this and endured a sleepless night. Although she did not refuse the next session, she was entirely unproductive.

After identifying and addressing the obstacle, our work resumed, and the frightening wish appeared next as the logically anticipated pathogenic memory. In this case, the wish initially surfaced in the patient's consciousness without the accompanying memories that placed this wish in the past. The current wish was then linked to me through the prevailing associative compulsion in her consciousness – a mistaken association which I call false linkage. This aroused the same affect that initially led the patient to repress the unacceptable wish. Once I experienced this, I presumed any similar occurrence involving me to be another instance of transference and false linkage. Interestingly, the patient repeatedly falls victim to this deception every time it happens.

One cannot complete an analysis without addressing the resistance arising from these incidences. However, the way forward can be found by deciding to treat this newly produced symptom in the same manner as the old ones. The primary task is to make the "obstacle" conscious for the patient. For instance, with one patient, when the pressure technique suddenly ceased to work and I suspected an unconscious idea similar to those mentioned in (2), I exposed it through surprise. I told her that an obstacle to continuing the treatment must have arisen, but the pressure technique at least had the power to reveal it. Then I pressed on her head. She, astonished, said, "I see you sitting here in the chair; isn’t that nonsense? What does that mean?" – I could then clarify the situation for her.

With another patient, the "obstacle" did not typically show itself through direct pressure, but I could always identify it by guiding the patient back to the moment when it first appeared. The process of revisiting that moment was never hindered by the technique of pressure. Identifying and proving the obstacle was the first challenge, but a bigger one remained. The larger challenge was encouraging the patient to share, particularly where personal relationships were involved and where the role of the third person coincided with the therapist's. Initially, I was quite frustrated by this additional psychological workload until I learned to understand the regularity of the process. I then realized that such transference didn't create a significant increase in the overall effort. The patient's task remained the same: to overcome the uncomfortable feeling that they could harbor such a wish, even momentarily. It seemed irrelevant to the success of the therapy whether the patient tackled this psychological rejection in a historical context or a present one with me. Patients gradually learned that such transferences to the therapist were a compulsion and an illusion, which would dissolve with the conclusion of the analysis. I believe that if I had failed to clarify the nature of the "obstacle" for them, I would simply have been substituting one hysterical symptom with another, albeit milder.

Now, I think I've provided enough hints about conducting such analyses and the experiences encountered during them. These might make things seem more complicated than they are; much becomes apparent by itself when you are engaged in such work. I did not list the difficulties to suggest that the demands on the therapist and the patient make cathartic analysis worthwhile only in the rarest cases. On the contrary, my clinical practice is influenced by the opposite assumption. Of course, I cannot lay out the most definite indications for using the therapeutic method described here without delving into the broader and more significant topic of neurosis therapy overall. I have often compared cathartic psychotherapy to surgical interventions, calling my treatments psychotherapeutic operations with analogies to opening a pus-filled cavity, scraping out a decayed area, and similar procedures. Such an analogy is justified not so much in the removal of the pathological element but in creating better healing conditions for the process to unfold.

I've often had patients voice an objection when I offered them help or relief through a cathartic cure: "You yourself say that my suffering is likely tied to my circumstances and fate, which you can't change; so how do you plan to help me?" To this, I could reply: "I don't doubt that it would be easier for fate than for me to cure your suffering; but you'll find that there's a lot to gain if we can transform your hysterical misery into common unhappiness. You'll be better equipped to cope with the latter once your mental health improves."
