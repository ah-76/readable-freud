Neurotic Family Romance (1909)
Freud discusses the process of children distancing themselves from their parents and the mental myth they construct around this journey. He explores how feelings of rivalry, neglect, and dissatisfaction shape a child's fantasies of independence, creating a psychological "family romance" that reflects their desire to redefine familial relationships.

The separation of the growing individual from parental authority is one of the most necessary yet painful achievements of development. It is absolutely essential that this separation occurs, and it's safe to assume that every person who reaches normality has accomplished this to some extent. Indeed, the progress of society depends on this opposition between the two generations. On the other hand, there's a group of neurotics whose condition reveals that they have failed in this task.

For the small child, the parents initially represent the only authority and the source of all belief. Becoming like them, that is, like the same-sex parent, and growing up to be like father or mother, is the most intense and consequential desire during these early years. However, with increasing intellectual development, the child gradually becomes aware of the categories to which the parents belong. They meet other parents, compare them to their own, and thus gain the right to question their uniqueness and incomparability.

Minor events in the child's life that create dissatisfaction prompt them to start criticizing their parents. They use the newfound knowledge that other parents might be preferable in certain respects to form this attitude against their own.

Too often, opportunities arise where the child feels neglected or, at the very least, senses a lack of the parents’ full love, particularly when they regret having to share it with other siblings. The feeling that their own affections are not fully reciprocated often finds expression in the commonly remembered childhood idea that they are a stepchild or an adopted child. Many people who haven't developed neuroses can still frequently recall moments like these, often influenced by their reading, where they interpreted and responded to their parents' hostile behavior in this way.

The influence of gender already shows itself here, as boys are much more inclined to harbor hostile feelings toward their father than toward their mother and have a far stronger desire to free themselves from him rather than her. Girls' imaginative activity in this regard tends to be much weaker. In these consciously remembered emotions from childhood, we find the element that enables us to understand the myth.

The next stage in this growing alienation from the parents, rarely consciously remembered but almost always demonstrable through psychoanalysis, can be called the "family romance" of neurotics. A distinctive feature of neurosis, as well as any higher talent, is a particularly active imagination, which first manifests in childhood games and later, around the time of prepuberty, seizes on the theme of family relationships. A characteristic example of this imaginative activity is the well-known daydreaming,¹ which continues far beyond puberty. 

Careful observation of these daydreams reveals that they serve to fulfill wishes and correct life and primarily have two aims: the erotic and the ambitious (often hiding the erotic behind the ambitious). Around this time, the child's imagination takes up the task of getting rid of their undervalued parents and replacing them with others who are usually of higher social status. The child seizes on chance encounters with real-life experiences (such as meeting the lord of the manor or landowner in the countryside or nobility in the city).

These chance encounters evoke the child's envy, which then finds expression in a fantasy replacing both parents with nobler figures. The skill and material available to the child determine the execution of these fantasies, which, of course, are conscious at this time. They vary in how much effort is put into making them seem plausible. This stage is reached when the child still lacks knowledge of the sexual conditions of origin.

When the child becomes aware of the diverse sexual relationships of the father and mother, understanding that *pater semper incertus est* while the mother is most certain, the family romance undergoes a peculiar restriction. It settles for elevating the father but doesn't question descent from the mother, which is seen as unchangeable. This second (sexual) stage of the family romance is also driven by a second motive that was absent in the first (asexual) stage. With the knowledge of sexual processes, there's a tendency to imagine erotic situations and relationships, motivated by the pleasure of placing the mother, the object of utmost sexual curiosity, in situations of secret infidelity and secret love affairs. In this way, those earlier, seemingly asexual fantasies are brought up to the level of current understanding.

Incidentally, the motive of revenge and retribution, which previously took center stage, also appears here. These neurotic children are often the same ones who were punished by their parents for giving up sexual habits and now seek revenge through such fantasies.

It's particularly the later-born children who, through such fantasies (much like in historical intrigues), strip their older siblings of their favored position. They often don't hesitate to ascribe as many love affairs to the mother as there are competitors. An interesting variation of this family romance is when the imaginative hero returns to legitimacy for themselves while eliminating their siblings as illegitimate in this way.

Moreover, the family romance can be guided by a particular interest due to its versatility and various applications, meeting all kinds of ambitions. For example, the little dreamer may use it to remove familial ties with a sister who might have sexually attracted him.

Anyone who recoils in horror at the corruption of a child's mind or even denies the possibility of such things should note that all these seemingly hostile fantasies are not as malevolent as they appear and, under slight disguise, preserve the child's original tenderness for their parents. It is only an apparent betrayal and ingratitude, for if one examines the most common of these family fantasies—replacing both parents or just the father with more distinguished figures—in detail, one discovers that these new and noble parents are invariably endowed with traits that stem from real memories of the actual lower-ranking parents. Thus, the child doesn't eliminate the father but elevates him. 

Indeed, the whole effort to replace the real father with a nobler one is simply the child's expression of longing for the lost happy time when they saw their father as the noblest and strongest man and their mother as the dearest and most beautiful woman. They turn away from the father they now recognize and back toward the one they believed in during their early childhood years. The fantasy is really just an expression of regret that this happy time has passed. Therefore, the overestimation of the earliest childhood years regains its full right in these fantasies.

An interesting contribution to this topic comes from the study of dreams. Dream interpretation teaches that even in later years, in dreams involving emperors or empresses, these illustrious figures represent the father and mother. Thus, the childhood overestimation of the parents remains in the dreams of a normal adult.
