High School Students (1914)
Freud, 58 years old, is asked to write an article for a school, leading him to reminisce about the male teachers who shaped his intellectual and emotional development. 

I have a peculiar feeling when, at such an advanced age, I'm asked once again to write an <em>Essay</em>, reminiscent of high school assignments. But I obey automatically, like that old soldier who, at the command <em>Attention!</em>, must place his hands along the seam of his trousers and let anything he carries fall to the ground. It's strange how readily I agree, as if nothing particularly remarkable has changed in the past 50 years. Yet I've grown old since then, standing on the threshold of sixty years, and both my body and the mirror unmistakably show how much of my life's light has already burned away.

About ten years ago [48yo], I could still have moments when I suddenly felt completely young again. While walking the streets of my hometown, already gray-bearded and burdened with the responsibilities of a bourgeois existence, I would unexpectedly encounter a well-preserved older gentleman who I would almost greet humbly because I recognized him as one of my high school teachers. But then I would stop and look pensively after him, wondering: 

<blockquote>Is he really the same person, or just someone who looks so deceptively similar? How youthful he looks, while I've aged so much! How old might he be today? Is it possible that these men, who represented adulthood to us back then, were only slightly older than I am now?</blockquote>

The present then felt obscured, and the years from 10 to 18 rose from the corners of my memory, with their premonitions and errors, painful transformations, and blissful successes. The first glimpses into a vanished cultural world, which at least for me would later become an unsurpassed consolation in the struggles of life, the first encounters with the sciences, among which I believed I could choose to which I would devote my — certainly invaluable — services. And I thought I remembered that the whole period was imbued with the premonition of a life-mission, which initially only hinted at itself until I could express it in bold words in my graduation essay: I wanted to contribute to human knowledge. 

I then became a medical doctor, but actually more of a psychologist, and was able to create a new psychological discipline. The so-called <em>psychoanalysis</em> now captivates doctors and researchers in nearby and distant countries, inspiring both praise and criticism - though least of all in my own homeland.

As a psychoanalyst, I must be more interested in affective than intellectual processes, and more concerned with the unconscious than the conscious aspects of the soul. My emotion upon meeting my former high school professor compels me to make a first confession: I don't know what mattered more to us or engaged us more deeply—the engagement with the sciences presented to us or with the personalities of our teachers. In any case, there was an unceasing undercurrent toward the latter among all of us, and for many, the path to the sciences lay solely through the personas of the teachers. Some got stuck on this path, and for a few, it was permanently blocked this way. Why shouldn't we admit it?

We courted them or turned away from them, imagined sympathies or antipathies that likely didn't exist, studied their characters, and shaped or distorted our own through them. They evoked our strongest rebellions and forced us into complete submission; we scrutinized their small weaknesses and were proud of their great virtues, their knowledge, and their sense of justice. Deep down, we loved them very much if they gave us any reason to do so. I don't know if all our teachers noticed this, but there's no denying it. We had a particular attitude toward them, one that likely had its inconveniences for those affected. We were equally inclined toward love as toward hate, toward criticism as toward admiration. Psychoanalysis calls this readiness for contradictory behavior <em>ambivalence</em>, and it's comfortable with identifying the source of this emotional ambivalence.

Psychoanalysis has taught us that the affective attitudes toward others, which are crucial for the individual's later behavior, are established at an unexpectedly early age. By the first 6 years of childhood, the child has already determined the nature and emotional tone of their relationships with people of the same and the opposite sex. From that point on, these relationships can be developed and transformed in particular directions, but not entirely abolished. The individuals to whom the child becomes attached in this way are their parents and siblings. All the people they meet later in life become substitute figures for these initial emotional objects (including caregivers alongside the parents) and fall into series that branch from the <strong>imagos</strong>, as we call them, of the father, mother, siblings, etc. Thus, later acquaintances inherit a kind of emotional legacy, encountering sympathies and antipathies for which they themselves have contributed very little. All later friendships and love choices are made based on memory traces left by those first role models.

Among the <strong>imagos</strong> of a usually forgotten childhood, none is more significant for a male than that of his father. Organic necessity has introduced emotional ambivalence into this relationship, whose most poignant expression can be found in the Greek myth of King Oedipus. The male child must love and admire his father, who appears to be the strongest, kindest, and wisest of all creatures; after all, God himself is but an exalted version of this father figure as it presents itself to the early child's mind. But very soon, the other side of this emotional relationship emerges. The father is also recognized as the overwhelming disruptor of one's own instinctual life, becoming a role model one not only wants to imitate but also wants to eliminate to take his place. The tender and hostile impulses toward the father now coexist, often throughout one's entire life, without one being able to cancel out the other. This coexistence of opposites characterizes what we call emotional ambivalence.

In the second half of childhood, a shift in this relationship with the father begins to take shape, the significance of which cannot be overestimated. The male child starts to look out from his nursery into the real world outside, and now he has to make discoveries that undermine his original high regard for his father and accelerate his detachment from this first ideal. He finds that his father is no longer the most powerful, wisest, or richest. He becomes dissatisfied with him, learns to criticize him and place him in a social context, and usually makes him pay dearly for the disappointment he has caused. Everything hopeful, but also everything offensive that characterizes the new generation, is conditional on this detachment from the father.

In this phase of a young person's development, they encounter their teachers. We now understand our relationship with our high school professors. The men, not all of whom were even fathers themselves, became father substitutes for us. That is why, even if they were very young, they seemed so mature and unreachable to us. We projected onto them the respect and expectations we had for the all-knowing father of our childhood years, and then began treating them like our fathers at home. We brought them the ambivalence we had developed in our families, and with this attitude, wrestled with them as we were used to wrestling with our biological fathers. Without understanding the nursery and the family home, our behavior toward our teachers would be incomprehensible but also inexcusable.

We also had other, and hardly less significant, experiences as high school students with the descendants of our siblings, our classmates, but these should be described elsewhere. The school's anniversary celebration focuses our thoughts on the <em>teachers</em>.
