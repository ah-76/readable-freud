The Psychic Mechanism of Hysterical Phenomena (1893)
Freud gives a talk on hysteria, in two parts, building on his work with Charcot and Breuer.  

I want to summarize a work whose first part was published under Josef Breuer's name and mine in the <em>Zentralblatt f√ºr Neurologie</em>. As you can see from the title, the work deals with the pathogenesis of hysterical symptoms and suggests that the immediate causes for the emergence of hysterical symptoms are to be found in the realm of psychic life. Before I go further into the content of this joint work, I must tell you where it fits and introduce the author and concept to which we have, at least in essence, linked ourselves, even though our contribution has developed quite independently.

All our recent advances in understanding and recognizing hysteria are tied to the work of Charcot. In the first half of the 1880s, Charcot began to focus his attention on the "great neurosis," as the French say: <strong>hysteria</strong>. Through a series of studies, he demonstrated regularity and order where inadequate or disheartened clinical observation by others had only seen simulation or enigmatic whim. One can say that directly or indirectly, everything we have learned about hysteria recently can be traced back to his initiative. 

Among Charcot's many works, none, in my estimation, stands higher than the one in which he taught us to understand the traumatic paralyses that occur in hysteria. And since it is precisely this work that our contribution appears to continue, I ask you to allow me to discuss this topic before you in greater detail once again.

Imagine a case where an individual who was previously healthy, perhaps not even burdened with hereditary factors, is struck by a trauma. This trauma must meet certain conditions: it must be severe, meaning that it involves the idea of life-threatening danger and existential threat. However, it should not be so severe that psychological activity ceases; otherwise, the effect we expect from it will not occur. For instance, it should not be accompanied by a concussion or a genuinely serious injury. Furthermore, this trauma must have a specific relationship to a particular body part. Imagine a heavy log strikes a worker on the shoulder. This blow knocks him down, but he soon convinces himself that nothing serious has happened and returns home with only a minor bruise. After several weeks or months, he wakes up one morning to find that the arm affected by the trauma hangs limp and paralyzed, even though he had been using it perfectly well during the incubation period.

If it's a typical case, peculiar attacks may occur: the individual suddenly collapses after an aura, rages, or deliriously rants. When speaking in this delirium, it becomes clear that the accident scene is repeating itself within him, perhaps embellished with various fantasies. What has happened here, and how can this phenomenon be explained?

Charcot explains this process by reproducing it, by artificially inducing the paralysis in a patient. He requires a patient who is already in a hysterical state, in a state of hypnosis, and the means of suggestion. He puts such a patient into deep hypnosis, gives them a light tap on the arm, and that arm falls limp, becomes paralyzed, and shows exactly the same symptoms as spontaneous traumatic paralysis. This tap can also be replaced by direct verbal suggestion: "You, your arm is paralyzed," and the paralysis exhibits the same characteristics.

Let us try to draw an analogy between these two cases: on one hand, the trauma, and on the other, the traumatic suggestion. The end effect, paralysis, is the same in both cases. If the trauma in one case can be replaced by verbal suggestion in the other, it stands to reason that even in spontaneous traumatic paralysis, a mental image was responsible for the paralysis. In fact, a number of patients report that at the moment of trauma, they truly had the sensation that their arm was shattered. Thus, the trauma would be entirely comparable to verbal suggestion.

However, a third factor is still missing to complete the analogy. For the suggestion "the arm is paralyzed" to truly induce paralysis in the patient, it was necessary that the patient be in a state of hypnosis. The worker was not in hypnosis, but we can assume that during the trauma, he was in a special state of mind, and Charcot is inclined to equate this affect to the artificially induced state of hypnosis. With this, spontaneous traumatic paralysis is fully explained and analogized with paralysis induced by suggestion, and the emergence of the symptom is clearly determined by the circumstances of the trauma.

Charcot has repeated the same experiment to explain the contractures and pains that occur in traumatic hysteria, and I would say that Charcot himself has hardly delved so deeply into understanding hysteria on any other point as he did on this particular issue. But here his analysis ends; we do not learn how other symptoms arise, and above all, we do not learn how the hysterical symptoms in ordinary, non-traumatic hysteria come about.
