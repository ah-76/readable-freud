Wild Psychoanalysis (1910)
Freud addresses the dangers of 'wild' psychoanalysis, where therapists misunderstand or misuse psychoanalytic principles. He uses the example of a woman misadvised by a doctor, highlighting the importance of tact in discussing sexuality with anyone, understanding the concept of psychosexuality, and the need for accurate knowledge of psychoanalytic concepts.

A few days ago, an older woman accompanied by a protective friend visited my office, complaining of anxiety attacks. She was in her late forties, still fairly well preserved, and had clearly not yet given up on her femininity. The onset of her condition had been triggered by her divorce from her last husband, but according to her, the anxiety had worsened considerably since she consulted a young doctor in her suburb. This doctor had explained to her that the root cause of her anxiety was her sexual neediness. He had told her that she could not do without relations with a man, and that there were only three ways to recover her health: she should either return to her husband, take a lover, or satisfy herself. Since then, she was convinced that she was incurable, because she did not want to return to her husband, and the other two solutions were against her morals and religious beliefs.

She had come to me because the doctor had told her that this was a new insight that could be attributed to me and that she should seek my confirmation that this was indeed the case. Her friend, an even older, unhealthy-looking woman, implored me to assure the patient that the doctor was mistaken. She insisted that it couldn't be true because she herself had been a widow for many years and had remained decent without suffering from anxiety.

I don't want to dwell on the difficult situation that this visit put me in, but rather to shed light on the behavior of the colleague who sent this patient to me. Before that, I'd like to mention a caveat that might—hopefully—be unnecessary. Years of experience have taught me—not unlike anyone else who would learn from it—not to easily accept as truth what patients, especially neurotic ones, tell about their doctor. The therapist can easily become the object of many hostile feelings from the patient during any kind of treatment. Sometimes, they have to accept being held responsible for the secret, repressed wishes of neurotics through a kind of projection. It's then a sad but telling fact that such accusations find credibility most easily among other doctors.

So, I have the right to hope that the woman in my office gave me a tendentious and distorted account of her doctor's statements, and that I am doing the doctor, personally unknown to me, an injustice if I base my remarks on "wild" psycho-analysis specifically on this case. But perhaps by doing so, I may prevent others from wronging their patients.

So, let's assume that the doctor spoke exactly as the patient reported to me.

<hr>

In that case, it’s easy for anyone to criticize that a doctor, if they find it necessary to discuss sexuality with a patient, must do so with tact and sensitivity. But these requirements align with following certain technical guidelines of psychoanalysis. Moreover, the doctor would have misunderstood or misinterpreted a series of scientific teachings of psychoanalysis, thus showing how little they have grasped its essence and intentions.

Let's start with the scientific errors. The doctor’s advice clearly reveals how they understand "sexual life"—namely, in the popular sense, where sexual needs are understood as nothing more than the need for intercourse or similar activities that lead to orgasm and the discharge of sexual substances. However, the doctor cannot have been unaware that psychoanalysis is often criticized for expanding the concept of sexuality far beyond its usual scope. The fact is accurate; whether it should be used as a criticism will not be discussed here. The concept of sexuality in psychoanalysis covers far more; it extends both below and above the popular sense. This expansion is justified genetically. I include in "sexual life" all expressions of tender feelings that originate from primitive sexual impulses, even if those impulses have experienced inhibition of their original sexual goals or replaced those goals with others that are no longer sexual.

I therefore prefer to speak of psychosexuality, emphasizing that the mental factor in sexual life should not be overlooked or underestimated. I use the word sexuality in the same comprehensive sense that the German language uses the word lieben - to love. I have long known that mental dissatisfaction, with all its consequences, can persist even when normal sexual intercourse is present. As a psychoanalytic therapist, I always remember that unsatisfied sexual impulses often find substitute satisfactions in neurotic symptoms. Only a small portion of these impulses can be relieved through intercourse or other sexual acts.

Anyone who does not share this understanding of psychosexuality has no right to rely on the principles of psychoanalysis that deal with the etiological significance of sexuality. By exclusively emphasizing the somatic factor in sexuality, they have certainly simplified the problem, but they must bear sole responsibility for their approach.

<hr>

The doctor’s advice reveals a second and equally serious misunderstanding.

It's true that psychoanalysis states sexual dissatisfaction is the cause of nervous disorders. But doesn't it say even more? If we set aside as too complicated the fact that it teaches that nervous symptoms arise from a conflict between two forces—a (usually overgrown) libido and an excessively strict sexual rejection or repression—what remains is crucial. Anyone who remembers this second factor, which isn't of lesser importance, will never believe that sexual satisfaction alone is a universally reliable remedy for the complaints of neurotics. A good portion of these people are not capable of satisfaction under the given circumstances or at all. If they were capable and did not have their internal resistances, the strength of their drive would guide them to satisfaction, even without a doctor’s advice.

So, what use is advice like the one the doctor allegedly gave to that woman?

Even if it can be scientifically justified, such advice is impractical for her. If she didn't have internal resistances to masturbation or to a love affair, she would have long since resorted to one of these remedies. Or does the doctor believe that a woman over forty years old is unaware that she can take a lover? Or do they overestimate their influence to such an extent that they think, without their medical approval, she would never be able to make such a decision?

<hr>

This all seems very clear, yet it's important to acknowledge that there's an element that often complicates judgment. Some nervous conditions, the so-called actual neuroses like typical neurasthenia and pure anxiety neurosis, clearly depend on the somatic factor of sexual life, while we don't yet have a clear understanding of the role of the psychological factor and repression in these cases. In such situations, it makes sense for the doctor to initially consider immediate treatment—a change in somatic sexual activity—and they are fully justified in doing so if their diagnosis is correct.

The woman who consulted the young doctor primarily complained of anxiety attacks. He probably assumed she was suffering from 'anxiety neurosis' and felt entitled to recommend a somatic therapy. Another convenient misunderstanding! Someone who suffers from anxiety does not necessarily have an anxiety neurosis. This diagnosis cannot be derived from the name alone. One must know which symptoms constitute an anxiety neurosis and distinguish them from other disorders that also manifest through anxiety.

The woman in question appeared to me to be suffering from anxiety hysteria, and the whole, but fully sufficient, value of such nosographic distinctions is that they point to a different etiology and therapy. Anyone who had considered the possibility of such anxiety hysteria would not have neglected the psychological factors as the doctor's alternative advice did.

<hr>

Curiously enough, in this therapeutic alternative offered by the supposed psychoanalyst, there's no room left for psychoanalysis. This woman is supposed to recover from her anxiety only if she returns to her husband or satisfies herself through masturbation or with a lover. So where does the analytical treatment fit in, which we see as the main remedy for anxiety disorders?

Thus, we've reached the technical errors we identify in the doctor's approach in this assumed case. The notion that a patient suffers due to some kind of ignorance and will recover once this ignorance is dispelled by informing them about the causal connections between their illness and their life, childhood experiences, etc., is a long-overcome, superficial view. It's not the lack of knowledge itself that is the pathogenic factor, but the internal resistances that first caused this ignorance and now maintain it. The task of therapy lies in overcoming these resistances. Sharing what the patient doesn't know because it has been repressed is only one of the necessary preparations for therapy.

If knowledge of the unconscious were as important to the patient as those inexperienced in psychoanalysis believe, then listening to lectures or reading books would be enough for them to recover. However, these measures have as much impact on neurotic symptoms as distributing menus during a famine has on hunger. This comparison is useful even beyond its first application, because sharing the unconscious with the patient usually results in intensifying their internal conflict and worsening their symptoms.

<hr>

Since psychoanalysis cannot do without such disclosure, it stipulates that it should only be made once two conditions are met. First, the patient must have come close to what they repressed through preparatory work. Second, they must have developed such a strong emotional attachment to the doctor (transference) that their relationship with the doctor makes a renewed escape impossible.

Only by fulfilling these conditions can we recognize and overcome the resistances that led to repression and ignorance. Thus, a psychoanalytic intervention absolutely requires prolonged contact with the patient. Attempts to surprise the patient by abruptly revealing the secrets the doctor has guessed during the first office visit are technically objectionable and often result in the doctor gaining the patient's hearty enmity, cutting off any further influence.

Quite apart from the fact that one sometimes guesses wrong and is never able to guess everything, psychoanalysis replaces the demand for the elusive "medical tact," in which a special talent is sought, with specific technical guidelines.

<hr>

Therefore, it's not enough for the doctor to know some of the results of psychoanalysis; one must also become familiar with its technique if one wishes to guide their medical practice using psychoanalytic principles. This technique cannot yet be learned from books and can only be discovered through significant sacrifices of time, effort, and success. It is learned, like other medical techniques, from those who have already mastered it.

Thus, in judging the case to which I'm linking these remarks, it's certainly not irrelevant that I don't know the doctor who is said to have given such advice and have never heard their name before.

<hr>

Neither my friends, colleagues, nor I take pleasure in monopolizing the practice of a medical technique in this way. However, given the dangers that the foreseeable practice of "wild" psychoanalysis brings to both the patients and the field of psychoanalysis itself, we had no other choice. In the spring of 1910, we founded an international psychoanalytic association whose members publicly declare their affiliation to it. This allows us to reject responsibility for the actions of those who don't belong to us and yet call their medical practices "psychoanalysis." 

In truth, such wild analysts do more harm to the field than to individual patients. I've often seen that even though such clumsy approaches initially worsen the patient's condition, they ultimately bring healing. Not always, but often enough. After the patient has cursed the doctor for long enough and feels sufficiently distanced from their influence, their symptoms diminish, or they decide to take a step toward healing. The final improvement is then said to have happened "on its own" or is credited to the highly indifferent treatment of another doctor the patient later consulted.

In the case of the woman whose accusation against the doctor we've heard, I'd say the wild psychoanalyst did more for her than any highly regarded authority who would have told her she had a "vasomotor neurosis." He forced her to see the real cause of her suffering or at least something close to it. Despite all the patient's resistance, this intervention will not go without positive effects. But he has damaged himself and helped to reinforce the prejudices that, due to understandable emotional resistances, patients hold against the activity of psychoanalysts. And this can be avoided.
