Artists and Daydreaming (1908)
Freud examines the function of playfulness in artistic creativity. (2930 words)  

As a layperson, I've always been intensely curious to know where this peculiar personality, the artist, gets their material from — akin to the question that the cardinal asked Ariosto — and how they manage to captivate me with it, stirring emotions within me that I might not have even thought myself capable of. My interest in this matter is only heightened by the fact that the artist themselves, when asked, gives me no answer or none that is satisfactory, and it isn't diminished at all by my awareness that the best insight into the conditions of artistic material selection and the nature of artistic creation would not contribute to making me an artist myself.

If only I could discover an activity in myself, or among people like me, that is somehow akin to art! An investigation into such an activity would let me hope for a first understanding of the artist's creative work. And indeed, there is some prospect of this — artists themselves love to minimize the distance between their uniqueness and general human nature; they frequently assure me that there's an artist in every person and that the last artist will die only with the last human being.

Shouldn't I look for the first traces of artistic activity in children? A child's favorite and most intense activity is play. Perhaps I can say that every playing child behaves like an artist, creating their own world or, more precisely, rearranging things in their world into a new order that pleases them. It would then be wrong to think that they don't take this world seriously; on the contrary, they take their play very seriously, investing large amounts of emotional energy in it. The opposite of play is not seriousness, but reality. Despite all the emotional investment, the child distinguishes their play world very well from reality and likes to base their imagined objects and relationships on tangible and visible things in the real world. Nothing but this reliance distinguishes the child's "play" from "daydreaming."

The artist does the same thing as the playing child: they create a fantasy world that they take very seriously, that is, they invest it with large amounts of emotional energy while sharply separating it from reality. And language has preserved this kinship between child’s play and artistic creation by calling the artist's endeavors that rely on tangible objects and are capable of representation as plays—comedy, tragedy—and the person who performs them as an actor. However, the unreality of the artistic world leads to significant consequences for artistic technique because much that could not be enjoyable in reality can still be so in the play of fantasy. Many emotions that would normally be painful can become a source of pleasure for the artist's audience.

Let's linger for a moment on the contrast between reality and play for another reason. 

When the child has grown up and stopped playing with toys, and after decades of mental effort has come to grasp life's realities with the necessary seriousness, one day they might find themselves in a mental state that dissolves the contrast between play and reality. The adult can recall the seriousness with which they once played as a child, and by equating their supposedly serious activities with those childhood games, they can cast off the oppressive weight of life and gain the immense pleasure of comedy.

The adolescent stops playing with toys and seemingly gives up the pleasure they derived from playing. But anyone who knows the human mind knows that hardly anything is more difficult for us than giving up a once-known pleasure. In reality, we don't give up anything - we just exchange one thing for another. What appears to be a 'renunciation' is actually a form of substitution, or a surrogate formation. So when the adolescent stops playing with toys, they are giving up nothing but the reliance on 'real objects'. Instead of playing with toys, they now <strong>daydream</strong>. They build castles <em>in the air</em>, creating versions called daydreams.

I believe that most people <em>create fantasies</em> at times in their lives. This fact has been long overlooked, and its significance not sufficiently appreciated.

The daydreaming of adults is less easy to observe than the playing of children. While children do play alone or form a closed psychological system with other children for the purpose of play, even if they don't perform for adults, they don't hide their play from them. Adults, however, are ashamed of their daydreams and conceal them from others; they nurture them as their innermost secrets and would generally prefer to confess their transgressions than share their fantasies. It may happen that an adult considers themselves the only one who creates such fantasies and has no idea of the widespread prevalence of similar creations in others. This difference in behavior between the playing child and the daydreaming adult is well-grounded in the motivation of these two activities, which are in many ways continuous.

The child's play was guided by desires, essentially by one desire that helps a child grow up: the <em>desire to be</em> grown-up and adult. They always play at "being grown-up," imitating in play what they have learned about the lives of adults. They have no reason to hide this desire. 

It's different for the adult. On one hand, they know that they're expected <em>not</em> to play or daydream anymore - but to act 'in the real world'. On the other hand, among those desires that generate their fantasies, are some that must be hidden altogether. So they are ashamed of their daydreaming, as childish and illicit.

<hr>

You might ask, "How can I know so much about people's daydreaming, when they conceal it with such secrecy?" Well, there is a type of person to whom not a god but a strict goddess — 'necessity' — has given the task of revealing what they suffer from and what they enjoy. These are the neurotics, who must also confess their fantasies to the psychoanalyst from whom they expect recovery through psychological treatment. My best knowledge comes from this source, and I have come to the well-founded assumption that: our patients share nothing different, than what we could also learn from healthy people.

Let's begin by understanding some of the characteristics of daydreaming. One can say that the happy person never daydreams, only the dissatisfied do. Unfulfilled wishes are the driving forces behind fantasies, and each fantasy is a wish-fulfillment, a correction of unsatisfying reality. The motivating desires vary according to the gender, character, and life circumstances of the person fantasizing, but they can be roughly grouped into two main directions: they are either ambitious desires, which serve to elevate the personality, or erotic desires.

In young women, erotic desires almost exclusively dominate, for their ambition is usually consumed by the pursuit of love. In young men, alongside erotic desires, selfish and ambitious wishes are also sufficiently prominent. However, I want to emphasize not the contrast between these two directions but rather their frequent union. Just as in many altarpieces, the donor's portrait is visible in one corner, in most ambitious fantasies, we can discover the lady in some corner for whom the dreamer performs all these heroic deeds and to whom he lays all his successes at her feet.

You see, there are enough strong motives here to keep fantasies hidden. The well-bred woman is generally only granted a minimum of erotic need, and the young man is supposed to learn to suppress the excess of self-esteem he brings from the indulgence of childhood to integrate himself into a society so rich in similarly ambitious individuals.

The products of this daydreaming activity — the individual fantasies, castles in the air, or daydreams — should not be imagined as rigid and unchangeable. Instead, they adapt to changing life impressions, altering with every fluctuation in life's circumstances, and receive a so-called "time stamp" from each new significant impression. The relationship between fantasy and time is particularly significant. One might say that a fantasy hovers, as it were, between three times, the three temporal moments of our thinking. The psychic work connects to a current impression, a stimulus in the present that could awaken one of the person's major desires, and then reaches back to the memory of an earlier, usually infantile, experience in which that desire was fulfilled. From there, it creates a situation related to the future, which appears to fulfill that desire—the daydream or fantasy, which now bears traces of its origin from the stimulus and the memory. Thus, past, present, and future are strung together on the thread of the ongoing desire.

The most banal example may illustrate my point. Take the case of a poor and orphaned young man who has been given the address of an employer where he might be able to find a job. On his way there, he might indulge in a daydream appropriate to his situation. The content of this fantasy will be something like this: that he is accepted there, pleases his new boss, becomes indispensable to the business, is drawn into the employer's family, marries the charming daughter of the house, and then takes over as co-owner and later as successor of the business. In doing so, the dreamer replaces what he had in his happy childhood: a protective home, loving parents, and the first objects of his tender affection. In this example, you can see how desire uses a present stimulus to create a vision of the future based on a past model.

Enough about fantasies, now to the artist! Can I really attempt to compare the artist with the "daydreamer in broad daylight" and their creations with daydreams? A first distinction immediately comes to mind; I must separate those artists who take on ready-made material, like the old epic poets and tragedians, from those who seem to create their own material freely. I will focus on the latter and, for my comparison, not choose the artists most highly regarded by critics but rather the more modest storytellers of novels, novellas, and tales who find the most numerous and enthusiastic readers.

One characteristic in the creations of these storytellers must stand out: they all have a hero who is at the center of interest, for whom the artist seeks to gain my sympathy by all means and whom they seem to protect with a special providence. If I leave the hero unconscious and bleeding from serious wounds at the end of a novel chapter, I'm sure to find him in the best care and on the road to recovery at the beginning of the next. If the first volume ends with the shipwreck in a sea storm where our hero was, I'm sure to read about his miraculous rescue at the beginning of the second volume, without which the novel would have no continuation.

The feeling of security with which I accompany the hero through his dangerous fates is the same as that of a real hero who plunges into the water to save a drowning person or exposes himself to enemy fire to storm a battery, the true heroic feeling which one of our best poets has given the wonderful expression: "Nothing can happen to you." (Ludwig Anzengruber)

But I think that by this telltale sign of invulnerability, one can easily recognize His Majesty, the self, the hero of all daydreams and all novels.

<hr>

Other typical features of these self-focused stories also point to the same kinship. When all the women in the novel fall in love with the hero, it's hardly meant to be a realistic depiction but is easily understood as a necessary part of the daydream. Likewise, when other characters in the novel are distinctly divided into good and evil, ignoring the variety of human characters observed in reality, the "good" are simply the helpers, while the "bad" are the enemies and competitors of the self that has become the hero.

I do not deny that many artistic creations are far removed from the model of the naive daydream, but I cannot suppress the suspicion that even the most extreme deviations could be linked to this model by a continuous series of transitions. Even in many of the so-called psychological novels, I have noticed that only one character, again the hero, is depicted from within; the artist, as it were, sits inside the hero's soul and looks at the other characters from the outside. The psychological novel, as a whole, probably owes its peculiarity to the modern artist's tendency to split their self into partial selves through self-observation and consequently personify the conflicting streams of their mental life in several heroes.

Novels you could call "eccentric," in which the character introduced as the hero plays the least active role and instead watches the actions and sufferings of others like a spectator, seem to be in stark contrast to the type of daydream. Several of Zola's later novels are of this kind. However, I must note that the psychological analysis of non-artistic individuals who deviate from the so-called norm in some respects has introduced us to analogous variations of daydreams, in which the self is content with the role of the spectator.

<hr>

If my comparison of the artist to the daydreamer, and the artistic creation to the daydream, is to be valuable, it must prove fruitful in some way. Let me attempt to apply my earlier statement about the relationship of fantasy to the past, present, and future - and to persistent lifelong desires - to the works of artists. I'll use it to study the relationship between the artist's life and their creations.

People have generally not known what expectations to bring to this problem and have often imagined this relationship far too simplistically. From the insight gained about fantasies, I should expect the following situation: a strong current experience awakens in the artist the memory of an earlier experience, usually one from childhood, from which emerges the desire that finds its fulfillment in the artistic creation. The work itself reveals elements of both the recent stimulus and the old memory.

Don't be alarmed by the complexity of this formula; I suspect that it will prove to be too simplistic in reality, but it may contain a first approximation to the real situation. Based on a few attempts I have made, I believe that such a perspective on artistic productions cannot be unproductive. You will remember that the perhaps surprising emphasis on childhood memory in the life of the artist ultimately derives from the assumption that artistic creation, like daydreaming, is a continuation and substitute for the child's former play.

<hr>

Let's not fail to refer to that class of literary works in which we don't see free creations but adaptations of ready-made and well-known material. Even in these cases, the artist retains some independence, which is expressed in their selection of material and often in significant modification. But to the extent that the material is given, it comes from the folk treasure of myths, legends, and fairy tales. The investigation of these cultural psychological formations is by no means complete, but it is quite likely, for instance, that myths correspond to the distorted remains of wish-fulfillment fantasies of entire nations—the secular dreams of early humanity.

You will say that I've told you far more about fantasies than about the artist, whom I placed first in the title of my lecture. I know this and attempt to excuse it by pointing to the current state of our knowledge. I could only offer you ideas and suggestions that extend from the study of fantasies to the problem of artistic material selection. We haven't even touched on the other problem of how the artist achieves the emotional effects they evoke through their creations.

I would like to at least show you the path that leads from our discussions about fantasies to the problems of artistic effects.

<hr>

You remember that I said the daydreamer carefully hides their fantasies from others because they feel reasons to be ashamed of them. I now add that even if they were to share them with us, such a revelation would not bring us any pleasure. When we hear about these fantasies, we are repelled or, at best, remain indifferent to them. But when the artist presents their games to us or tells us what we are inclined to interpret as their personal daydreams, we feel great pleasure, probably flowing from many sources. How the artist achieves this is their own secret; in the technique of overcoming that repulsion, which surely has to do with the barriers that arise between each individual self and the others, lies the true <em>ars poetica</em>, the essence and technique of creative artistry.

We can guess at two techniques the artist uses: the artist softens the self-focused nature of the daydream through modifications and disguises and wins us over with pure formal, that is, aesthetic, pleasure in presenting their fantasies. Such a pleasure - offered to pave the way for greater pleasure from deeper psychological sources - is called an 'enticement reward' or 'preliminary pleasure'. I believe that all aesthetic pleasure the artist provides has the character of such forepleasure and that the true enjoyment of artistic works comes from the release of tensions in our soul.

Perhaps it even contributes quite a bit to this effect that the artist enables us to enjoy our own fantasies without any reproach or shame. Here, I stand at the threshold of new, interesting, and intricate investigations but, at least for now, at the end of our discussions.
