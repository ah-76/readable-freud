The Psychology of Dream Processes (1900)
In Chapter 7 of "Interpreting Dreams" Freud examines the nature and process of dream production.   

<strong>INTRODUCTION</strong>

Among the dreams I've learned about through others, there is one that now especially demands my attention. A patient told it to me - who herself had heard it during a lecture on dreams. Its original source remains unknown to me. Nevertheless, it made a deep impression on her because she didn't hesitate to "re-dream" it - meaning she repeated elements of the dream in one of <em>her own dreams</em>, to express agreement on a specific point through this transference.

The situation of this exemplary dream is as follows: 

<blockquote><samp>INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT<br> 
<br>A FATHER has kept vigil for days and nights at the bedside of his sick CHILD. 
<br>After the child dies, father retires to an adjacent room to recover - but leaves the door open so that he can see into the room where the child's body lies surrounded by large candles. 
<br>An OLD MAN has been appointed to keep watch and sits beside the body, murmuring prayers. 
<br>After a few hours of sleep, the father dreams that the child stands by his bed, grabs his arm, and reproachfully whispers, 
<br>CHILD: "Father, don't you see that I'm burning?" - 
<br>Father wakes up and notices a bright light shining from the room with the body. 
<br>He rushes over and finds the Elderly Watchman asleep - with the shroud and one arm of the precious body burned: 
<br>by a CANDLE that had fallen onto it.</samp></blockquote>

I think the explanation of this touching dream is simple enough, and, according to my patient, was honestly given by the lecturer. The bright light shone through the open door into the sleeper's eyes and prompted the same conclusion he would have made while awake: that a candle had fallen over and a fire had started near the body. Perhaps the father had even taken into his sleep a 'concern' that the Elderly Watchman might not be up to his task.

I wouldn't change much about this interpretation. I'd only add that the content of the dream seems overdetermined, the child's words composed of things they actually said in life, and that are linked to important events involving the father. The complaint "I'm burning" might relate to the very Fever the child died from. And the words "Father, don't you see?" to another - unknown - but emotionally significant occasion.

However, once I've recognized the dream as a meaningful process, that fits into the context of other psychic events, I can marvel that a dream occurred at all, under circumstances where a quick awakening was vital. I then notice that this dream, too, does not lack an aspect of wish fulfillment. In the dream, the dead child behaves like a living one: it admonishes the father, comes to his bed, pulls on his arm - no dout just as in the memory the dream used for the first part of the child's speech. For the sake of this wish fulfillment, the father prolonged his sleep by a moment. The dream took precedence over waking thought, because it could show the child alive once again. Had the father woken first and then drawn the conclusion that led him to the room with the body, he would have, as it were, shortened the child's life by that one moment.

There’s no doubt what makes this little dream so captivating. Until now, I've mostly been concerned with the hidden meaning of dreams, how it can be uncovered, and what methods the dream-work uses to conceal it. The task of dream interpretation have been at the center of my attention. And now I encounter this dream, which poses no challenge for interpretation, whose meaning is given openly, and I become aware that this dream still retains the essential characteristics by which a dream markedly differs from our waking thoughts and stimulates our need for explanation. After eliminating everything related to <em>interpretation</em>, I realize just how incomplete my psychology of dreams has been.

<hr>

Before I embark on this new path with my thoughts, I want to pause and look back to see if I have overlooked anything important on my journey thus far. I must realize that the comfortable and pleasant stretch of my path is behind me. If I’m not mistaken, all the paths I've taken so far have led to enlightenment, clarity, and full understanding. From the moment I want to delve deeper into the mental processes of dreaming, all paths will lead into darkness. It's impossible to explain the dream as a psychological process because explaining means relating it to something familiar. Currently, there is no psychological knowledge that can serve as a foundation for what can be inferred from a psychological examination of dreams. 

On the contrary, I'll be forced to make a series of new assumptions that brush up against hypotheses about the structure of the mental apparatus and the interplay of forces at work inside. I must be careful not to elaborate them too far beyond the first logical connection, otherwise their value will be lost in vagueness. Even if I don't make any logical errors and consider all logically resulting possibilities, the probable incompleteness in the approach to the elements threatens to completely derail my calculations.

A thorough examination of the dream, or any other isolated mental function, cannot provide a clear understanding of the construction and operation of the mind or at least cannot substantiate it. Instead, I will need to gather information from the comparative study of a whole series of mental functions that prove to be consistently required. The psychological assumptions that I draw from the analysis of <em>dream</em> processes will therefore have to wait at a stop, so to speak - until they connect with the results of <em>other</em> investigations, that seek to penetrate to the core of the same problem from a different point of attack.

<strong>SECTION F - The Unconscious and Consciousness: Reality</strong>

Upon closer inspection, it's not the existence of two systems near the motor end of the apparatus but rather two kinds of processes or types of excitation flow that are suggested by the psychological discussions in the preceding sections. It would be all the same to me, because I must always be ready to abandon my auxiliary concepts when I believe I am in a position to replace them with something closer to the unknown reality. Let me now attempt to clarify certain notions that might have been misinterpreted while I considered the two systems as two localities within the mental apparatus in the most immediate and crude sense—ideas that left their mark in terms like "repression" and "penetration."

When I say that an unconscious thought strives for translation into the preconscious so that it can then penetrate into consciousness, I do not mean that a second thought is to be formed in a new location, like a heading, next to which the original continues to exist. I also want to carefully separate the idea of location change from the notion of penetrating consciousness. When I say that a preconscious thought is repressed and then taken up by the unconscious, these images, borrowed from the concept of the struggle over terrain, could tempt me to assume that in one mental locality, an arrangement is truly dissolved and replaced by a new one in another locality.

<hr>

Instead of these analogies, I will replace them with what seems to better correspond to the actual situation: that an energy investment is placed on a particular arrangement or withdrawn from it, so that the mental structure falls under the control of one agency or is removed from it. Here, again, I replace a topographical way of thinking with a dynamic one; it's not the mental structure that appears to me as the movable element, but rather its innervation.

Nevertheless, I consider it practical and justified to continue cultivating the vivid concept of the two systems. I avoid any misuse of this representation by remembering that representations, thoughts, and mental structures, in general, should not be localized in the organic elements of the nervous system but rather, so to speak, between them, where resistances and pathways form their corresponding correlates. Everything that can become the subject of my inner perception is virtual, like the image given by the path of light rays through a telescope. However, the systems themselves, which are not psychological in nature and never accessible to our psychological perception, may be assumed to be like the lenses of the telescope that create the image. Continuing this analogy, the censorship between two systems corresponds to the refraction of rays when transitioning into a new medium.

<strong>The Overestimation of Consciousness</strong>

I have so far pursued psychology on my own; it is time to consider the prevailing doctrines that dominate contemporary psychology and examine their relationship to my findings. According to Lipps's emphatic words, the question of the unconscious in psychology is less a psychological question than the question of psychology. As long as psychology dealt with this question through word explanations that "the psychological" is simply "the conscious" and "unconscious psychological processes" are a palpable contradiction, it excluded any psychological utilization of the observations an analyst could make in abnormal mental states. Only when both the analyst and the philosopher recognize that unconscious psychological processes are "the appropriate and well-justified expression for an established fact" do they come together.

The analyst cannot help but shrug at the assertion that "consciousness is the indispensable characteristic of the psychological," and, if their respect for the statements of philosophers remains strong enough, assume that they are not dealing with the same subject or practicing the same science. For even a single insightful observation of the mental life of a neurotic, a single dream analysis, must force the unwavering conviction that the most complex and accurate thought processes, which one would certainly not deny the name of psychological processes, can occur without arousing the person's consciousness. 

Certainly, the analyst does not receive any knowledge of these unconscious processes until they have had an effect on consciousness that allows for communication or observation. However, this effect on consciousness can show a psychological character entirely different from the unconscious process itself, so much so that inner perception cannot possibly recognize one as a substitute for the other. The doctor must preserve the right to deduce unconscious psychological processes from the effects on consciousness. They learn through this process that the effect on consciousness is only a distant psychological consequence of the unconscious process and that the latter has not become conscious as such, and that it existed and operated without revealing itself to consciousness in any way.
