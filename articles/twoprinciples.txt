Two Principles of Mental Functioning (1911)
Freud examines how the mind shifts from the mental-pleasure principle, which seeks immediate gratification, to the world principle, which engages with the world. He explores how mental problems involve a withdrawal from the world, and the role of repression in shaping this world/pleasure conflict.

I've long known that every neurosis tends to push the patient out of real life and alienate them from the world. This fact did not escape Pierre Janet's observation either. He spoke of a loss of 'the link to the world' [la jonction du réel] as a distinctive feature of neurotics. But he did not uncover the connection between this disturbance and the fundamental conditions of neurosis.

The introduction of the 'process of repression' into the genesis of neurosis has allowed me to gain insight into this connection. The neurotic turns away from the world because they find it intolerable — either in whole or in part. The most extreme type of this withdrawal from the world is shown in certain cases of hallucinatory psychosis, where the event that triggered the insanity is fully denied. But in a way, every neurotic does the same with <em>some piece</em> of the world.

My task is to investigate the relationship between the neurotic and the world — and that of human beings in general — in terms of their development, and thereby integrate the psychological significance of the external world into my framework.

In sychoanalytic psychology, I take unconscious mental processes as a starting point, the characteristics of which have become known to me through analysis. I regard these as older, primary processes, remnants from a developmental phase in which they were the only type of mental processes. The highest tendency to which these primary processes adhere is easily recognized. It is called the pleasure-unpleasure principle - or simply the pleasure principle. These processes aim to gain mental pleasure, and the psyche withdraws from acts that can cause unpleasure (repression). Our nocturnal dreaming, and our waking tendency to break away from distressing impressions, are remnants of the rule of this principle - and evidence of its power.

I draw on ideas I've developed elsewhere (in the general section of <em>Interpreting Dreams</em>) to hypothesize that: our state of 'mental rest' was initially disturbed by the imperious demands of internal needs. In this case, the thought (the wish) was simply set hallucinatorily, as still happens every night with our dream thoughts. Only the absence of the expected satisfaction, the disappointment, led to the abandonment of this attempt to achieve satisfaction through hallucinatory means. Instead, the mental apparatus had to resolve to represent the real conditions of the external world and strive for real change.

So, a new principle of mental activity was introduced: no longer a matter of representing what was pleasant, but what was real <em>even if</em> it was unpleasant. The introduction of the world principle proved to be a significant step.

<strong>SECTION 1</strong>

At first, the new demands necessitated several adaptations of the mental apparatus that I can only mention briefly due to our inadequate or uncertain understanding.

The increased importance of the external world also elevated the significance of the sensory organs oriented toward the outside world and the consciousness connected to them, which learned to perceive not only the pleasure and displeasure qualities that were previously of sole interest but also the sensory qualities. A special function was established that periodically examined the external world so that its data would be known in advance when an urgent internal need arose—this function is attention. This activity seeks out sensory impressions instead of waiting for them to appear. Probably simultaneously, a system of remembering was implemented that had to store the results of this periodic conscious activity—a part of what I call memory.

Instead of repression, which excluded some emerging ideas from investment because they produced displeasure, impartial judgment took its place, aiming to determine whether a particular idea was true or false—that is, whether it aligned with the world or not—and made this decision by comparing it with the memory traces of the world.

Motor discharge, which had served to relieve the mental apparatus from increased stimulation under the dominance of the pleasure principle, and had fulfilled this function through internal body innervations (facial expressions, emotional reactions), now acquired a new function: it was used to purposefully change the world. It transformed into action.

The necessary delay of motor discharge (action) was managed by the process of thinking, which developed from the act of imagining. Thinking was equipped with features that enabled the mental apparatus to endure the increased tension during the delay of discharge. Essentially, it is a trial action involving the shifting of smaller quantities of energy with minimal expenditure (discharge) of the same. This required converting freely transferable energies into bound ones, which was achieved through a general elevation of the investment process.

Thinking was probably originally unconscious as far as it extended beyond mere imagining and focused on the relations of sensory impressions. It only acquired additional qualities perceptible to consciousness through its connection to word remnants.

<strong>SECTION 2</strong>

A general tendency of our mental apparatus, which can be traced back to the economic principle of effort-saving, seems to manifest itself in the stubbornness of holding on to available sources of pleasure and the difficulty in giving them up. With the establishment of the world principle, a form of thinking was split off that remained free from world testing and subject only to the pleasure principle. This is fantasizing, which begins with children's play and later continues as daydreaming, eventually abandoning its reliance on real objects.

<strong>SECTION 3</strong>

The replacement of the pleasure principle by the world principle, along with the resulting psychological consequences, which here are captured in a single sentence for the sake of a schematic overview, does not occur all at once or simultaneously across the board. While this development takes place among the self-drives, the sexual drives separate themselves from them in a very significant way. Initially, the sexual drives behave autoerotically, finding satisfaction in their own bodies, thereby avoiding the situation of frustration that forced the adoption of the world principle.

When later the process of finding an object begins for them, it soon undergoes a long interruption due to the latency period, which delays sexual development until puberty. These two factors—autoeroticism and the latency period—cause the sexual drive to be held back in its psychological development and to remain under the dominance of the pleasure principle for much longer, a principle from which many people are ultimately never able to detach themselves.

Due to these circumstances, a closer relationship develops between the sexual drive and fantasy on one side, and the self-drives and conscious activities on the other. This relationship is evident in both healthy individuals and neurotics as a very intimate one, although these considerations from genetic psychology reveal it to be secondary. The persistence of autoeroticism makes it possible for the easier, immediate, and fantastical satisfaction with the sexual object to be maintained in place of the real satisfaction, which requires effort and delay, for so long.

Repression remains all-powerful in the realm of fantasy, managing to block ideas in their nascent state—before they can reach consciousness—if their investment might lead to the release of displeasure. This is the weak point of our mental organization, which can be exploited to bring thinking processes that have already become rational back under the control of the pleasure principle. So, a significant part of the psychological predisposition to neurosis is provided by the delayed education of the sexual drive to take the world into account and by the conditions that make this delay possible.

<strong>SECTION 4</strong>

Just as the pleasure-self can only wish, seek pleasure, and avoid displeasure, so the world-self needs only to strive for usefulness and guard against harm. In the world, the replacement of the pleasure principle by the world principle does not mean a rejection of the pleasure principle but merely its safeguarding. An immediate and uncertain pleasure is given up only to gain a later, more secure pleasure through a new approach. However, the internal psychological impact of this replacement has been so powerful that it is reflected in a particular religious myth.

The doctrine of reward in the afterlife for the voluntary or enforced renunciation of earthly pleasures is nothing more than the mythical projection of this psychological upheaval. Religions, in consistent pursuit of this model, have been able to enforce absolute pleasure renunciation in life against the promise of compensation in a future existence, yet they have not managed to overcome the pleasure principle in this way. This is most successfully achieved by science, which also offers intellectual pleasure during work and promises practical benefits in the end.

<strong>SECTION 5</strong>

Education can undoubtedly be described as an encouragement to overcome the pleasure principle and replace it with the world principle. It aims to assist this developmental process concerning the self and uses love rewards from educators for this purpose. However, it fails if the spoiled child believes that they already possess this love and cannot lose it under any circumstances.

<strong>SECTION 6</strong>

Art achieves a reconciliation between the two principles in a unique way. An artist is initially a person who turns away from the world because they cannot come to terms with its demands for renunciation of instinctual gratification. They allow their erotic and ambitious wishes to flourish in their fantasy life. However, the artist finds a way back from this fantasy world to the world, by using their special talents to shape their fantasies into a new kind of world that people accept as <em>valuable representations of the world</em>. In this way the artist truly becomes the hero, king, creator, and favorite that they wanted to be - without having to make the massive detour of changing the external world.

This is only possible because other people feel the same dissatisfaction with the required renunciation of the world, as the artist does. The dissatisfaction that results from replacing the pleasure principle with the world principle is itself a part of the world.

<strong>SECTION 7</strong>

While the self undergoes the transformation from pleasure-self to the world-self, the sexual drives undergo changes that lead them from initial autoeroticism (through various intermediate stages) to object love in service of the reproductive function. If it's correct that every stage of these two developmental paths can become the basis for a predisposition to later neurotic illness, it is reasonable to assume that the form of future illness (the 'choice' of neurosis) depends on the phase of self and libido development at which the predisposing developmental inhibition occurred. The as-yet-unstudied temporal characteristics of these two developments, and their potential shifts relative to one another, therefore take on unexpected significance.

<strong>SECTION 8</strong>

The most bewildering characteristic of unconscious (repressed) processes, which every investigator has to gradually get used to, is that world-testing holds no value for them. World-thought is equated with the external world, and a wish is considered equivalent to its fulfillment or an actual event, directly deriving from the dominance of the old pleasure principle. For this reason, it's challenging to distinguish unconscious fantasies from unconscious memories.

However, one should never be tempted to impose world evaluations on repressed psychic formations, undervaluing fantasies in symptom formation because they are not real events, or deriving a neurotic sense of guilt from elsewhere because no actual crime can be found. One must use the currency prevalent in the land being explored—in our case, neurotic values. For instance, consider solving a dream like the following:

A man who once took care of his father during his prolonged and agonizing illness reported that, in the months following his father's death, he repeatedly dreamed that his father was alive again and that he was talking to him as usual. However, he felt deeply pained that his father had already died and just didn't know it. The only way to understand this nonsensical-sounding dream is to add "according to his wish" or "as a result of his wish" after the phrase "that his father had already died" and add "that he [the dreamer] wished it" to the last words. The dream thought then reads: "It is a painful memory for him that he had to wish for his father's death (as a release) while he was still alive, and how terrible it would have been if his father had suspected it."

This is a known case of self-reproach following the loss of a loved one. In this example, the reproach harks back to the childhood significance of the death wish against the father.

<strong>CLOSING</strong>

The shortcomings of this brief essay, which is more preparatory than comprehensive, can only be partially excused if I claim them as unavoidable. In the few sentences about the psychological consequences of adapting to the world principle, I had to hint at ideas I would have preferred to withhold for now, as justifying them will undoubtedly require considerable effort. However, I hope that sympathetic readers will notice where, even in this work, the dominance of the world principle begins.
